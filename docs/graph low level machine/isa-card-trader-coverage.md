# ISA coverage map — the card-trader banks against the opcode set

> **The ISA arc, Phase 0 (coverage map) + Phase 1 (predicate-NAC) + Phase 2 (existential NACs /

> The plan (handoff "Next step"): migrate the shipped reasoning onto the label-less / goal-directed
> machine (`harneskills/isa/`), using the card-trader banks + scenario harness as a DIFFERENTIAL-TEST
> ORACLE, so domain reasoning has *nowhere to hardcode* (a domain-blind machine + a dumb lowering).
> This doc is the Phase-0 map: every card-trader bank's rules against the opcode set
> (`SEED`/`FOLLOW`/`JOIN`/`GRADE`/`FUZZY`/`MINT`/`EMIT`/`DROP_CTRL`) and the NAC shapes, with each

> Read `isa-reference.md` (the opcode semantics + the honest verdict) and `rule-isa-design.md`

> → a fixed generic machine, all domain content MUST be CNL rules — the guard becomes structure.

## The opcode set (recap)

| Opcode | Role | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `SEED` | enumerate nodes by key (rarest-anchor) | match |
| `FOLLOW` / `JOIN` | pointer-register edge cursor / follow-then-test | match |
| `TEST` / `SAME` | crisp filter / register unification (repeated var) | match |
| `GRADE` / `FUZZY` | graded α-cut on a bound reg / graded seed | match |
| `MINT` / `EMIT` | reify a relation-or-node / monotone fact write | effect |
| `DROP_CTRL` | delete a CONTROL edge (refuses a fact edge) | effect |

Negation is **not** an opcode (no `CHECK-ABSENT`): a NAC is materialized as a positive `R_not` fact
and matched with `SEED`/`TEST` — the decide line. Aggregation is **not** an opcode (it folds across
the state stream) — a `<call>` calculator, by design. Neither is exercised the way that matters here:
the card trader has no aggregation, and ranking is discrete/structural.

## Bank-by-bank coverage

Legend: **✅ covered** (positive/graded fragment already reproduced, `test_isa_lowering.py` /
`test_isa_goal*`), **🟩 Phase 1/2** (predicate-NAC completion + existential-NAC emptiness checks + `DROP_CTRL` subsumed,
done), **🟧 Phase 3** (goal-directed planner + the `chosen` selection), **⬛ tool** (`<call>`, outside
the machine).

## The frontier, precisely

**Phase 1 (DONE this session) — ground-object, body-bound-subject predicate NACs.** `isa/goal.py`
`_lower_nac` + `_complete_negative` generalized from the copula (`is`/`is_not`) to an ARBITRARY
relation: `not ?s R o` → positive body clause `?s R_not o`, completed by a nested-complete-solve of
`R(s, o)` (the copula being just `R = is`). This covers the BULK of the card-trader NACs —
`overridden`, `stance`, `excluded`, `reachable`, `needs_price`, `ranked`, `dominated`, `best`.
Differential-tested against the STRATIFIED forward driver (`authoring.run_rules`) on the real
`preference.cnl` stance bank and the full `policy.cnl` override bank (`test_isa_goal_predicate_nac.py`,
6 tests): the goal-directed completion reproduces the stratified answer exactly — including the
demo's keystone, `today outranks standing` → `sell overridden` → the exclusion lifted. (Note: the
oracle is `run_rules`, the stratified driver, NOT `rewriter.run`; the naive single-fixpoint driver
evaluates a NAC against a partial graph and derives the unsound `op stance neutral` alongside
`op stance encouraged` — the completion's nested-complete-solve is the goal-directed analog of
stratifying the producer below the consumer, which is what makes it sound.)

**Phase 2 (DONE 2026-07-06) — the two EXISTENTIAL NAC shapes, and `DROP_CTRL` SUBSUMED.**
`tests/test_isa_goal_existential_nac.py`. `_lower_nac` now PARTITIONS a rule's NACs: a clause with a
NAC-LOCAL free var is EXISTENTIAL (grouped by shared free var, applied per env as a demand-driven
emptiness check — `_exist_nac_blocks`/`_group_satisfiable`); a fully-bound clause stays the ground
`R_not` path. This lifts both shapes the Phase-1 slice rejected:
- **¬∃p (variable object)** — `not ?o blocked_by ?anyp`: the head fires iff `blocked_by(o, ?)` has no
  witness, the subgoal solved to completion in a nested solve.
- **grouped ¬∃x (shared free subject)** — `not ?x A and not ?x B`: grouped into ONE conjunctive
  existential (the forward engine's `not (A and B)` reading), blocked iff a joint witness exists;
  two DISTINCT free vars stay independent groups (`¬A ∧ ¬B`, either blocks).

- **`DROP_CTRL` is SUBSUMED, not needed** — the load-bearing finding. The block/unblock idiom's
  `drop ?o blocked_by ?p …` exists only to RETRACT a block the forward engine asserts prematurely;
  on the demand path `blocked_by` is computed against COMPLETE reachability, so no stale block is ever
  asserted and the `drop` rule (empty rhs) is INERT. DIFFERENTIAL-TESTED against the ACTUAL planner
  driver — the repeat-`run_rules`-until-stable loop of `planning.plan`, where `drop` IS load-bearing —
  the goal solver reproduces the loop's final `viable`/`reachable` exactly, `blocked_by` empty in both.
  (A single stratified `run_rules` sweep under-derives; the mutual viable↔reachable recursion needs the
  loop, which is why the loop is the oracle, not a lone sweep.)
- **The one Phase-3 residual, isolated** — the `chosen` commit rule's grouped NAC references its OWN
  head (`not ?x chosen …`): a non-stratified SELECTION the forward engine resolves by commit-ORDER,
  not completion. `_lower_nac` REJECTS it (a grouped existential NAC whose predicate == a head
  predicate). Loading the WHOLE `corpus/planning.cnl` bank raises on exactly this one rule — every
  other rule lowers — so Phase 3's remaining scope is precisely operational choice for `chosen`.

**Phase 3 CORE (DONE 2026-07-07; the `solve.py` DRIVER RETIRED 2026-07-11, Phase 5.5 slice 4) — the
goal-directed planner.** `harneskills/isa/solve.py` (`derive_plan` + `run_to_goal`; `tests/test_isa_solve.py`).
NOTE: the `solve.py` Python driver is DELETED from `ugm` — its plan→act→check→replan control flow is now a
KB-declared composition over the existing `<call>` loop (`ugm/tests/test_isa_plan_act_check.py`); the
harness-side card-trader consumers migrate onto it cross-repo. The forward-fixpoint loop is replaced by
`GoalSolver` demand-forward: a goal PULLS only its AND-OR chain (measured — goal-directed `reachable` is
a STRICT SUBSET of forward's; it never saturates the goal fact). The `chosen` SELECTION is the ratified
resolution CHAIN — preferences (the `dominated`/`best` CNL) resolve a unique best DETERMINISTICALLY (the
selection mostly SUBSUMED); a genuine tie → a KB-prescribed `tie_break` `<call>`; else a deterministic-
arbitrary pick (stable order, not RNG). The whole control-TEARDOWN bank (`planning_teardown.cnl`, 15
gated drops) is SUBSUMED: control (`chosen`/`done`/viable/ready/…) is DRIVER-held and injected into a
fresh per-cycle `AttrGraph`, so the persistent graph stays purely monotone and a replan is a driver-state
reset (the `DROP_CTRL` subsumption of Phase 2, now for the entire replan machinery). Differential-tested
vs `planning.solve` — happy → `done`, withheld-effect divergence → replan → `done`, dead goal → `stuck`.

**Phase 3 REMAINDER (DONE 2026-07-07) — the tool boundary + the non-toy stress case.** (1) The rank
`<call>` tool serviced GOAL-DIRECTED: `GoalSolver` gained a `tools` registry (a TOOL-BACKED relation → a
calculator run ONCE on first demand); `cheaper_than` is backed by `rank_cheaper_than`, so a `dominated`
subgoal demands the ordering → the tool mints it → `dominated`/`best` complete. A COST preference (chain
step 1) breaks a tie by cost, and `examples/coffee.py` reproduces `plan()` exactly (`test_isa_solve.py`).
(2) The card-trader stress case (`test_isa_solve_cards.py`): `run_to_goal` drives the real
`cards_frontier_kb.cnl` + value→plan bridge + full `POLICY_RULES` — the bridge's DERIVED operator effect
is observed via demand-forward add-resolution (`_observe_simulated`), object-scoped deontic exclusion (a
predicate-NAC) + override work on the demand path. **The ISA arc is now SEMANTICALLY COMPLETE on the
planner**; what remains is the HONEST GATE (production parity to retire `rewriter.run`).

**Non-issues.** No aggregation in the card trader (ranking is discrete/structural), so the one thing
the ISA can't express isn't exercised. `<call>` tools (rank/price/act) stay Python calculators
OUTSIDE the machine (⬛ rows) — the `rank` tool derives `cheaper_than`, which the positive `dominated`
rule then joins on, so the tool boundary composes cleanly with the covered fragment.

## The honest gate (unchanged)

The reference machine proves SEMANTICS, not SPEED. `rewriter.run` carries the profiled
matching-bound wins (df-indexed rarest-anchor SEED, hub-flooding avoidance, semi-naïve delta
matching); dropping it from the shipped engine is gated on PRODUCTION PARITY, not on this coverage
map. Phases 2–3 are where the name-based engine does things the positive-core ISA has only shown on
smaller fragments — expect those to drive the remaining work.
