# Meaning-surfaces audit — "define X's meaning and use it", and where the sprawl is

> **Status: AUDIT (2026-07-22), then PARTLY BUILT.** Commissioned before adding a first-class

> **BUILT 2026-07-22 (suite 873 green):**

## 0. The headline (so it is not re-derived)

1. **"Define meaning and use it" is NOT a missing engine primitive.** A definition's *sufficient*
   direction is an ordinary rule (`grandparent := parent∘parent` → `grandparent(alice,carol)` is
   POSITIVE); its *necessary/existential* direction is a bound-literal skolem head (given
   `grandparent(a,d)`, "someone a parents" and "someone parents d" are POSITIVE). Both NATIVE
   (binder spike E1/E2). **The gap is ergonomic**: no first-class biconditional-definition construct,
   and meaning-giving is scattered across many surfaces.
2. **The sprawl is TWO axes, and only one is bounded by the meta-wall:**
   - **Loaders (entry points): ~13 distinct `load_*`/`ingest`/`parse_*` functions.** Pure accretion —
     each feature grew its own CNL loader; the modern intake (`ingest`/`load_kb`) was meant to subsume
     them and comparative/uncertainty/corpus never migrated. **Fully collapsible. This is the real
     drastic simplification.**
   - **Expanders (declaration → rules): per-relation/per-dimension RULE GENERATORS.** Long assumed to
     be quote-wall-bound — **but §5 (corrected) shows the wall is already CLIMBED**: `learner.py`
     writes variable-bearing rules today. The expanders are Python §8 tools by pragmatic **choice**,
     not necessity. Collapsible in principle; whether to is a purity/extensibility call, not a
     capability one — see §5.

## 1. The table — meaning surfaces × {LOC, live entry, produces, can-be-a-rule?}

| # | Surface | Module (LOC) | Live entry point | Produces | Can be a *pure* rule? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Production / machine rules | `machine_rules` (210), `production_rule` | `ingest`→grammar route; `load_machine_rules` | `Rule` (sufficient-cond definition) | **IS a rule** |
| 2 | Forms (`form K : H when B`) | `form_authoring` (217) | `ingest` authoring cluster; `load_forms` | `Rule` over the token chain (a recognizer definition) | **IS a rule** (stable key is the only extra) |
| 3 | Relation-properties (`R is transitive`) | `rule_graph` (`_property_rule`) | **`expand_relation_properties` — TOOL, not in `ingest`** | declaration fact → generated `Rule`(s) | **Python tool BY CHOICE** — could be a rule-writing-rule (§5) |
| 4 | Category disjointness (`A disjoint from B`) | `rule_graph` (`_disjoint_rule`) | same tool | fact → generated contradiction `Rule` | **Python tool by choice** (§5) |
| 5 | Comparatives (`x more D than y`) | `comparative` (304) | **`load_comparative` — standalone, only `world.py`+tests** | `<comparison>` edge + generated per-dim transitivity `Rule`s + bespoke ask/explain/lint | transitivity generated (rule-able, §5); surface+bridge bespoke |
| 6 | Uncertainty / hedge (`x is likely P`) | `uncertainty` (221) | **`load_uncertain`/`load_line` — only `world.py`+`grammar`** | banded **FORK** (an epistemic SCOPE), not a rule | **N/A — it authors a SCOPE** (family B) |
| 7 | Universal reasoning (`is_a` trans, `same_as`, entailed-neg) | `universal` (134) | exported `UNIVERSAL_RULES`/generators, wired into the reasoning setup | hand `Rule`s + per-predicate generated `Rule`s | hand rules ARE rules; generators = Python by choice (§5) |
| — | L0 vocabulary (`wolf is a noun`) | `grammar_intake` `VOCABULARY_FORMS` | `ingest` (route: `vocabulary`) | lexicon REGISTER entry (data, not meaning) | n/a (data emitter) |
| — | Procedures (`to N : A then B`) | `procedure_surface` (88) | `ingest` (`parse_define`) | `step`/`step_before` FACTS for the stepping bank | n/a (data emitter) |

## 2. Three families (the classification that organizes the cut)

- **A. Rule-definitions** — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5(part), 7. All ARE or COMPILE TO `Rule`s; a rule is a
  (sufficient-condition) definition. This is what a **`define`** surface unifies at the authoring
  layer.
- **B. Scope-authoring (relativized meaning)** — 6 (hedge→epistemic fork), and the arc's own
  `holder`/`temporal`/`@?t`. These author KINDED SCOPES. **Already being unified** by scope
  generalization; `uncertainty.py`'s forks are the same object as a `holder` scope minus/plus a band.
- **C. Data/lexicon emitters** — vocabulary, procedures. Not definitions; leave alone.

The insight: the system reinvented **A** seven times because each concept shipped its own
*surface + expander + reader + linter*. **B** was the same story until scope generalization started
folding it into one kinded mechanism. The "define meaning" capability the user wants is **A**'s
missing common surface; the "drastic simplification" is collapsing **A**'s loaders (§3) and, where
the wall allows, its expanders behind that surface (§4).

## 3. Immediate cuts — evidence-backed, confidence-labeled

**HIGH confidence (mechanical, no capability lost):**
- **⭐ Loader convergence — STEP 1 DONE 2026-07-22 (suite 890 green).** `comparative.load_comparative`,
  `uncertainty.load_uncertain` were standalone entry points duplicating what `intake.ingest`/`load_kb`
  do. The intake dispatch now has a `comparison` / `hedge` Outcome kind (two additive FALLBACK routes,
  reusing `parse_comparative` / `uncertainty.load_line` as the thin recognizers). `load_comparative` had
  ZERO live non-test callers; `load_uncertain` only `world.py`. Measured, not assumed — the canonical
  grammar refuses both, so nothing is stolen. The batch loaders STAY (the intake routes reuse their pure
  parsers); what step 1 delivered is reaching the surfaces through the MODERN intake.
- **`world.py` binds comparative+uncertainty+facts together** — a composite DEMO loader, not core. It
  still uses `load_corpus` (not `ingest`), so turning `load_world` into "ingest in a loop" is STEP 2's
  batch-loader contract change, not step 1's additive routing. Deferred with §3-MEDIUM below.

**MEDIUM (needs a design nod — it changes a contract, which the user has OK'd):**
- **The two batch loaders** `load_corpus` (legacy 2-pass, whole-batch) vs `load_kb` (declare-before-
  use) — the plan already flagged this as "a convergence question." Pick `load_kb`'s contract, port
  the corpus benches, delete `load_corpus` + `load_loose_rules`.
- **`rules_in_graph` (Pat reader) is used by NO reasoning-engine path** — only tests, the binder
  spike, and the `__init__` export (the demand chain reads `_read_atoms`; forward reads lowered ISA).
  It is a tool, not load-bearing; a candidate to demote/inline if the Pat 2-hop schema is retired in
  favor of the flat `<cond>` schema (they are two encodings of one thing — see §5).

**LOW / DO-NOT-CUT (load-bearing despite looking redundant):**
- The **two reified rule schemas** (Pat 2-hop vs flat `<cond>`) look like duplication but the flat one
  is the LEARNER-writable encoding (a rule's RHS cannot build the 2-hop shape — it cannot name the
  relation node). Keep both until the meta-circular story changes.
- The **three rule representations** (Pat, reified-graph, lowered-ISA) are each load-bearing (forward
  `run_bank` drives the grammar banks; demand drives reasoning). Converging them is the Rust/firmware
  long-game, NOT this cut.

## 4. The `define` surface — what it absorbs

A single authoring form, lowering to the rules that already work:

```
define grandparent(?x, ?z)  as  parent(?x, ?y) and parent(?y, ?z)      # sufficient (the rule)
define bachelor(?x)         as  man(?x) and not married(?x)            # with NAF
```

- **Lowers to a `Rule`** (family A) — identical to `load_machine_rules` output, so it rides the
  existing demand chain unchanged. This is 80% of the value: ONE surface, prose-adjacent, for what is
  now spread across machine-rules/forms/universal.
- **Biconditional option** (`define … iff …`) additionally emits the *necessary* rule(s) with
  bound-literal skolem heads for the existential witnesses — the E1/E2 pattern, already NATIVE. This
  is the genuinely new ergonomic: one statement, both directions.
- **Absorbs relation-properties and disjointness AS DECLARATIONS** — `define transitive R` / `define A
  disjoint from B` become spellings under the one `define` umbrella, **dispatching to the existing
  Python expanders** (§5). The user writes one kind of statement; the system still compiles the
  generated ones through the §8 tool.
- **Does NOT absorb family B** (hedges/forks): "x is likely P" is relativized meaning → a SCOPE, and
  belongs with `holder`/`temporal` under scope generalization, not `define`. Keeping them apart is the
  three-roles invariant (S2), not an oversight.

## 5. The quote/eval "wall" — ALREADY CLIMBED (corrected 2026-07-22)

> **This section originally claimed the wall makes the expanders un-rule-able. That was WRONG, and
> `learner.py` + a live probe disprove it.** Corrected here so the mistake is not propagated.

**A rule CAN write a rule containing a variable, today.** Probe: mark `tweety` (a bird that flies)
`observe`, run the learner — it WRITES the rule `?x can fly when ?x is_a bird`, and that written rule
is usable (`robin is_a bird` → `can(robin,fly)` is POSITIVE). So "rules that write rules" is live,
not deferred (`learner.COOCCURRENCE`).

**What actually makes it work — three primitives that SIDESTEP the wall without breaking it:**
1. the FLAT `<cond>` schema (`k_subj`/`k_pred`/`k_obj`), which an RHS *can* build (unlike the 2-hop
   `subj→pred→obj` path, which it cannot — that is the only thing still un-writable directly);
2. INTERNED pattern-variable nodes — a control node literally NAMED `?x`, referenced through a
   `pat_var` pool, so the learner never writes the *token* `?x` (which would be read as a variable);
   point `k_subj` at that node and `expand_rules` reads it back AS a variable;
3. REIFIED predicate tokens (`pred_tok` calculator) joined by a `ValueMatch`, so `k_pred` has a node
   to point at for a merely-observed predicate.

**So the real state of the wall:**
- **Rules-that-write-rules: OPEN** (proven). Every Python expander in the table (relation-properties,
  `disjoint`, comparative-transitivity, `same_as`, `entailed_negation`) **could** be a rule-that-
  writes-a-rule via primitives 1–3. They remain Python §8 tools by **pragmatic choice and history**
  (they predate the learner), **not by necessity.**
- **Still genuinely walled: only the ERGONOMIC form** — writing `'?a` DIRECTLY as a token in a rule's
  RHS. The classifier reads `?a` as a variable, and there is no QUOTE/staging token to say "literal
  `?a`". You don't need it (point at an interned node), but it is what would make a rule-writing rule
  *read* naturally instead of via the pool indirection.

**Consequence for the `define` surface (and the "address the wall?" question):** addressing the wall
is a *choice*, not a research problem, between (a) reexpress the expanders as rules-that-write-rules
using primitives 1–3 — no new mechanism, pure uniformity — or (b) add a genuine QUOTE token so
`define transitive R` and user-authored meta-patterns read naturally. Reasons to be cautious: full
metacircularity was **deliberately deferred as a PURITY milestone** (`CHANGELOG`: "deferred as a
purity milestone off Phase 4's path") because the capability was already met more cheaply; the Python
expanders are ~5 small correct functions and reexpressing them invites the learner's class of subtle
bugs (pred_tok non-termination, value-join-not-edge, the scaffolding filter). It buys UNIFORMITY, not
capability — **except** the one real capability gain: letting a USER define new rule-generating
*patterns* (their own `transitive`) at runtime, which (b)'s quote token would make in-language
authorable. That is the deepest form of "define meaning and use it," and the only reason to spend on
the wall now.

## 6. Recommended sequencing

1. **Loader convergence (HIGH cuts)** — ✅ **STEP 1 DONE 2026-07-22:** route comparative + uncertainty
   through `intake` (`comparison`/`hedge` Outcomes). The batch loaders stay as thin recognizers the
   routes reuse; deleting `load_world` as a separate entry point is folded into step 2 (it depends on
   `load_corpus`). Mechanical, no wall.
2. **Batch-loader convergence (MEDIUM)** — `load_kb` contract wins; retire `load_corpus` +
   `load_world`. **← the next slice.**
3. **The `define` surface (family A)** — one form → `Rule`; then fold relation-properties/disjoint
   spellings under it (dispatching to their expanders). Delivers the capability.
4. **Leave family B to scope generalization** — hedges are forks are scopes; that unification is
   already in flight and is where "in context C, X means …" (definitional/theory scopes) would land.
