# Changelog — the one-substrate rebuild

Reverse-chronological log of the ground-up rebuild onto `docs/vision.md`. Newest first.
Test counts are `pytest tests/ -q`. Nothing is committed automatically — the user commits
manually, so "N tests green" is the state at that point, not a commit.

For the **index of everything**, read `docs/reference.md`. For the **current plan and next
step**, read `docs/implementation_plan.md`. For the **design philosophy**, read
`docs/vision.md`. Deep rationale for most entries lives in the `memory/` decision/finding
files (linked inline). Older entries reference docs now in `docs/attic/` — that is expected;
this log is itself a historical record.

## 2026-07-12

### pystrider feedback #6 — read-only `suppose(commit=False)` (343 passed)
Closes the last ergonomics gap from the pystrider spike (`docs/feedback_from_pystrider.md` #6). `suppose`
committed assumptions to ink on CONFIRM and swept everything otherwise, so a hypothesis-driven analyzer had
to copy/rebuild the KB per query and could not inspect WHY a run was inconclusive. `suppose(..., commit=
False)` is now READ-ONLY: it inks nothing (a CONFIRMED run only reports the verdict), returns the in-scope
DERIVED consequences in `SupposeResult.derived` (seed assumptions excluded) for inspection — including the
partial derivations of an INCONCLUSIVE run — then sweeps the pencil, leaving the KB's committed facts
unchanged. `explain_suppose` renders the derivations. Default `commit=True` is behaviour-identical
(`derived` empty). `suppose.py` `_scope_derivations`; `tests/test_feedback_fixes.py` (+3). A brand-new
entity NAME in an assumption still mints its node — pass `ById` for a fully pure call.

### Coreference-as-rules Stage 4 — forward value-JOIN + same-name coref as a declared rule (340 passed)
The mechanical `wire_same_as` ingest default is retired: coreference becomes a DECLARED rule the author
controls, and it now fires in BOTH engines. Two parts.
- **Forward value-JOIN op (`machine.VMATCH`).** The Stage-1 residual ("forward-APPLY value-JOIN is a later
  companion") lands: a two-register value-match filter, the sibling of `GRADE` (one register) — exact
  VALUED equality or graded `1-|Δ|>=threshold` across two ALREADY-bound vars. `lowering.lower_value_matches`
  emits it (var must be LHS-bound, else `Unlowerable`), wired into `lower_rule` + `_lower_bank_rule`; the two
  `Unlowerable` refusals are gone. So value-match rules run under `run_bank`/`run_rules`, not just the demand
  chain.
- **Same-name coref as ONE declared rule over a universal marker.** `forms.mark_mentions` tags every surface
  ENTITY `is_a <mention>` (same content filter as `wire_same_as` — skip predicates/structural/`<…>`/`?`);
  `universal.same_name_coref_rules()` is the single rule `?x same_as ?y when ?x is_a <mention> and ?y is_a
  <mention> and <same-value ?x ?y name>`. This SEPARATES marking (policy-neutral "this is an entity") from
  the coref DECISION (the rule) — `wire_same_as` fused them. The marker is a POSITION-AGNOSTIC handle, so an
  untyped entity that appears as a subject in one line and an object in another (`vanilla is in_stock` /
  `alice wants vanilla`) corefs without any per-domain type — the wall that sank the per-type approach.
  `load_corpus`/`load_facts` call `mark_mentions` + the universal rule in place of `wire_same_as`.
  DECIDABLE via CNL: an author scopes coref by conditioning the body (`when ?x is a person …`), swaps the
  criterion (`?x close bright as ?y` for embedding coref), asserts identity directly, or drops it — the
  marker never forces a policy.
- Marker filtered from entity-facing reads it would leak into as a pseudo-fact: `derived_triples` and
  `focus.utterance_subjects` (like the existing `same_as` skip).
- MENTION const in `vocabulary.py`. `tests/test_isa_value_match.py` (forward fires + unbound-var loud);
  `test_isa_byid`/`test_isa_idcore` unchanged (id-core intact). REMAINING (optional): delete the retired
  `canonicalize` merge + rewrite its 4 `test_new_core` users; `wire_same_as`/`coref_in_context` kept as
  opt-in tools (no longer the default). OPEN: `load_corpus` auto-injects the universal rule (demos green) vs
  silent-by-default.

### Coreference-as-rules Stage 3 — the id-addressed core (339 passed)
The demand chain's env now binds node **ids** in free slots, not names — the change the "load-bearing
finding" flagged as the prerequisite for same-NAME coref. The headline payoff: two DISTINCT nodes that
happen to share a name bind to DISTINCT variables, so a same-name value-match RELATES them
(`same_as(a1,a2)`) instead of collapsing to one binding that could only emit a self-loop.
- **`chain._facts_matching` returns a `ById` for a FREE slot** (the discovered node by id), where it used
  to return the node's name. BOUND slots and LITERALS are untouched (they still pass a name/`ById`
  verbatim). This is the whole conceptual change; C had already made every downstream consumer
  (`resolve_write_node`/EMIT, `_bound_entity_nodes`/value-matches, `ById`-aware `_facts_matching`, the
  demand-mint via `_demand_endpoint`) id-aware, so the blast radius was tiny.
- **`_unify_head_with_demand(fact_g, …)`** — a demand endpoint may now be a `ById` (an id-addressed goal,
  or a sub-demand raised from a free var the body bound to a node); a head VAR takes it verbatim (the
  id-addressed seed), a head LITERAL is matched against the id's NAME (new `_endpoint_name` helper).
- **`_graded_ok`** reads a `ById`-bound var through `_bound_entity_nodes` (was `nodes_named`, which a
  `ById` would break). `_tok_name`/`_bind` doc'd to carry names OR `ById`s; var agreement stays plain
  equality (a distinct same-named node has a DIFFERENT id and correctly fails to unify).
- **`gather_open_premises` (query.py)** resolves demand endpoints id→NAME at the USER boundary (the ask
  speaks names) and dedups the id/name form of one premise — the id-core made the mid-chain gather
  sometimes raise a premise by id, exposing a latent hash-seed-flaky test; now deterministic.
- Side effect: the full suite dropped ~161s→~74s (pinning one id beats iterating same-named candidates).
- `tests/test_isa_idcore.py` (+4: same-name coref relates two distinct nodes / id-seeded goal /
  composition across the derived link / no-rule gate); `test_isa_byid.py` updated (free subject now a
  `ById`). NEXT: **Stage 4** — same-name coref as a standard declared bank; retire mechanical
  `wire_same_as` as the default.

### Coreference-as-rules Stage 2 — CNL surface + coref as a declared rule (335 passed)
The value-match primitive (Stage 1) becomes AUTHORABLE and coreference becomes DECLARED bank data.
- **CNL surface** (user-chosen): `?x same DIM as ?y` (EXACT) / `?x close DIM as ?y` (graded 'close
  enough'). New rule-body forms `_VALUE_SAME`/`_VALUE_CLOSE` (`authoring.py`, `_value_match_form`), with
  `same`/`close` is_kw-tagged so the generic body clause defers (like the copula/degree sugar); `DIM`
  binds `vm_dim`. Folds `<rule> -[rl_value_match|rl_value_close]-> <cond>`; `_expand_rule_node` reflects
  it into `Rule.value_matches` (exact → `threshold=None`; close → `DEFAULT_CLOSENESS=0.8`, a declarable-
  degree refinement deferred). `_dropped_conditions` learns the two new roles so a folded value-match
  clause isn't mis-reported as malformed.
- **Coref as a declared rule, end to end.** `?x same_as ?y when ?x is a body and ?y is a body and ?x
  close bright as ?y`, loaded via `load_rules`, run through `ask_goal`: two entities with close `bright`
  embeddings derive `same_as`, and `same_as_rules` carry one's `visible` onto the other — `is eveningstar
  visible` → yes; a far entity (`pluto`) → no; and WITHOUT the rule → no (coref-following is DATA, not
  baked in). Validates the whole coref-as-rules direction on today's core with NO engine rewrite.
- Additive; `tests/test_isa_value_match.py` (+4: exact/graded folding, the coref composition + gate).
  NEXT: **Stage 3** — the id-addressed core (env binds ids), which unlocks same-NAME value-coref.

### Coreference-as-rules Stage 1 — the value-match primitive (331 passed)
D was reframed with the user (`docs/coreference_as_rules_design.md`): a mechanical "same name ⇒ same
node" ingest merge bakes an NLP judgment into the engine, against the "logic lives in banks" discipline.
New direction — **every mention stays a separate node; coreference becomes DECLARED rules** — enabled by a
new match primitive. Stage 1 lands that primitive.
- **`ValueMatch` (`production_rule.py`)** — a match-time condition joining TWO LHS-bound variables by an
  ATTRIBUTE VALUE (`var_a`, `var_b`, `dim`, `threshold?`): the substrate's first DECLARED value-JOIN,
  beside the default topological join (the path language has no "these two nodes share a value" predicate —
  the reason coref was a §8 tool). `Rule.value_matches` carries them. EXACT equality of a VALUED `dim`
  (threshold None); graded 'close enough' on a GRADED `dim` (`1 - |Δ| >= threshold`) when set.
- **Reified + checked like the graded α-cut.** `rule_graph.write_rule` reifies `<rule> -[value_match]->
  <value_match>` (`vm_a`/`vm_b`/`vm_dim`/`vm_threshold`); the demand chain reads them
  (`chain._read_value_matches`) and applies the join DURING matching (`_value_matches_ok`, beside
  `_graded_ok`) — reading each endpoint's attribute off its bound node(s). Additive: no value_matches =
  identical behaviour.
- **Forward path refuses LOUDLY.** `lowering._reject_unsupported` + `_lower_bank_rule` raise `Unlowerable`
  on a value_match rule (mirroring the inverted-graded guard) rather than fire the join unconstrained — a
  value_match rule runs via `chain_sip`, not `run_bank`. The forward-APPLY value-JOIN op is a later companion.
- **Validated on today's (name-keyed) core** for the cases it supports: EXACT equality across DIFFERENT
  names (alice/bob share `dept` → coworker; carol excluded) and GRADED closeness (morningstar≈eveningstar
  by `warmth`; pluto excluded). Exact same-NAME coref needs the id-addressed core (Stage 3): the name-keyed
  env collapses two same-named nodes to one binding, so `?x same_value ?y name` can't distinguish them yet.
  Reflexive self-pairs are inherent (a distinctness constraint also awaits the id-core). `ValueMatch`
  exported. `tests/test_isa_value_match.py` (6): exact join/exclusion, missing-attr no-fire, graded
  close/far + threshold boundary, reification round-trip, forward refusal. NEXT: **Stage 2** — a CNL
  authoring form for the condition + a declared coref bank demo (cross-name/graded), composing via
  `same_as_rules`.

### Phase 8 NEXT STEP C — id-addressed goal path (`ById`) (325 passed)
The last of the seven pystrider feedback items: the tuple-goal APIs addressed entities by NAME, and on a
DUPLICATE name the write/seed side silently took `nodes_named(...)[0]`, forcing a consumer with
legitimately DISTINCT same-named nodes (built directly, not via CNL) into global name-uniqueness. C makes
the endpoints accept a `ById(node_id)` pin — **additive; the name path is untouched** (CNL consumers
unaffected). Design in `implementation_plan.md` NEXT STEP; deep rationale there and in the design-key
(split coreference into ingest-side same-name binding vs core `same_as`).
- **`chain.ById`** — a frozen node-id endpoint. New helpers: `_candidate_nodes` (pin vs value-accelerator
  on the READ side), `_endpoint_matches` (id-identity vs name-equality), `resolve_write_node` (the SINGLE
  write-target discipline), `validate_ids` (boundary check). Exported from the package.
- **Seed + EMIT.** `_facts_matching` walks out of the pinned node (bound slot returns the given endpoint
  so a var stays pinned through `_bind`/EMIT; free slot returns the discovered name); `_node_for_name`
  (EMIT), `suppose._resolve` (pencil), `query._materialize_fact` (ask-user) all route through
  `resolve_write_node`, so a `ById` head/assumption lands on exactly that node. Probe-verified: `check`
  over two distinct `ada`s returns POSITIVE for the thief and ASSUMED_NO for the other, and the derived
  `is thief` fact lands on the pinned node only.
- **Silent → LOUD (same theme).** A stale `ById` (node absent) RAISES at the boundary
  (`chain_sip`/`suppose` call `validate_ids`) instead of seeding empty / writing a phantom. And writing
  through a NAME that resolves to >1 GENUINELY DISTINCT entity WARNS before the `[0]`-pick, naming the
  site and pointing at `ById`. The warn is coref-aware and entity-aware: repeated `same_as`-linked
  mentions of ONE identity (`_one_identity`, undirected `same_as` BFS) and reified rule/call-clause
  scaffolding (`_is_fact_entity` — a node reachable only through control clause vocabulary is not an
  entity a write competes for) stay quiet, so the value-accelerator's normal multi-mention state does not
  flood. Residual: 5 benign warnings in `test_isa_suppose_calls.py`, where the mode-call CNL authoring
  path genuinely leaves 2 unlinked same-named nodes (coref isn't run there) — an honest signal, not noise.
- Tests: `tests/test_isa_byid.py` (11) — pinned query/EMIT/object-endpoint, suppose pinning + inconclusive
  when the wrong node is pinned, stale-pin raises (check + suppose), warn on distinct / no-warn on
  single/coref/`ById`. User-guide note added (`engine_user_guide.md` §2 "Addressing a specific node by id"
  + cheat-sheet row). NEXT: **D** — migrate the CNL entry points to resolve names→ids at the boundary and
  sit on these id primitives (id-addressed core; same-name binding relocates to ingest). ⚠Opus.

### Consumer feedback: six items hardened (silent → LOUD) + suppose focus-scope (314 passed)
From the pystrider spike (`docs/feedback_from_pystrider.md`) — the recurring pain was ugm quietly doing
LESS rather than erroring when a consumer authors rules/facts programmatically. Fixed six of the seven
items (the 7th, name-vs-id addressing, is the C→D NEXT STEP in the plan):
- **#1 machine-rule mis-parse (the footgun).** `load_machine_rules` silently mangled a clause that wasn't
  a full `S P O` triple — a 2-token clause swallowed the following `when`/`and` as its object, or a short
  body clause dropped, quietly weakening the rule. Now `authoring.machine_rule_defects` reads the FOLD
  result (not a Python re-parse of the grammar) and `load_machine_rules` RAISES `ValueError` naming the
  clause(s), with the hint to write a boolean-shaped predicate as `?g guard_open yes`. Mirrors the prose
  `load_rules` `_dropped_conditions` check, over both the machine head (`rl_head`/`rl_drop`) and shared body.
- **#4 `apply_*` cryptic `TypeError`.** Passing a `Rule` object (e.g. `rules_in_graph(rg)[0]`) where a
  rule-NODE id was expected failed with `unhashable type: 'Rule'` deep in `relations_from`. `apply_rule`/
  `apply_to_fixpoint` now validate at the boundary (`_require_rule_node`) with a clear message pointing at
  `write_rule`'s return value.
- **#5 `load_facts` silent drop.** An `S P O` line with an unknown/undeclared verb stayed raw tokens with
  no signal. `load_facts(…, strict=True)` now RAISES listing the dropped line(s); default `False` keeps
  the lenient behaviour. The content-fact detector `anchor_has_content_fact` moved to `authoring.py` and is
  now SHARED with `intake.ingest`'s fact-vs-unrecognized routing (was duplicated).
- **#2 existential / skolem RHS-only head var (option A — reject; genuine minting deferred).** Worse than a
  lying docstring: forward chaining minted a fresh UNNAMED node every firing (never suppressed by
  check-before-derive → the rule re-fires, results invisible to `derived_triples`); the demand chain
  collapsed the var onto the query goal. The loaders now REJECT a rule with a head var absent from the body
  (`production_rule.rhs_only_head_vars` + `authoring.reject_rhs_only_head_vars`), run AFTER the
  malformed-clause check so the more specific defect wins, pointing at the MINT-tool / pre-materialized-pool
  workaround. Bound-literal skolem binders (`<rule>?`/`<cond>?`) and NAC-bound head vars are excluded (no
  false positives across the banks). The `lowering.py` docstring is corrected. Genuine per-match minting
  (option C) deferred — the pre-materialized-pool workaround does not need it.

- **#3 CNL case-fold false negative.** A CNL question lowercases identifiers, so a query about a
  case-PRESERVED node (`eB`, made via the tuple API) folded to `eb` and returned a SILENT `no`. `ask_goal`
  now WARNS (`query._warn_case_folded_mismatch`) when a folded query name matches no node but a case-variant
  node exists — the folding stays (CNL and tuple paths documented to differ), the silence goes. Precise: no
  noise on all-lowercase or genuinely-absent names.
- **#7 `suppose` bounded attention.** `suppose(…, focus_scope=…)` now threads into its in-scope
  `chain_sip`/`_facts_matching` exactly as `ask_goal` does, so a hypothesis-driven consumer can bound the
  OUTCOME path (not just the trace path) to the working set. `None` = whole-graph (behaviour-identical).

New exports: `ingest`/`converse`/`Outcome`/`Event`/`intake`/`focus`/`rule_control`/`is_neg_pred`/
`anchor_has_content_fact`. `tests/test_feedback_fixes.py` (13). Still OPEN: #6 (`suppose(commit=False)` — a
self-contained feature) and the #2-genuine-minting (option C, behind the `reject_rhs_only_head_vars` hook).
The one architectural item — pystrider's name-vs-id addressing (`nodes_named(...)[0]` on duplicates) — is
the plan's NEXT STEP as C (id-addressed goal path, unblocks pystrider) → D (id-core, names at the CNL edge).

### Phase 8.5b: MID-CHAIN ask — gather the open premises a derivation needs (301 passed)
Closed a SILENT-WRONG-answer hole: a rule blocked only by an OPEN premise (`safe when cleared`, with
`cleared` open) used to return a confident `ASSUMED_NO` and NEVER ask, because `ask_goal` only gathered
evidence for the TOP goal's own open predicate, not for open predicates sitting in a rule BODY. Now
`ask_goal.gather_open_premises` asks the human/tool for those premises, materializes the confirmed ones,
and re-decides — so the reasoner gathers what it needs to reach a conclusion (`docs/cnl_intake_design.md`
§5). WHICH premises to ask is DERIVED, never hardcoded (§D): the candidates are the visible bound
`<demand>` magic-set the backward closure itself produced (`chain.bound_demands`), filtered by the FIRMWARE
openness STANCE (`policy.is_open`) and skipping internal NAF neg-predicate demands via the substrate naming
convention (`vocabulary.is_neg_pred`, added) — no predicate/English-word list in Python decides it.
MULTIPLE distinct asks per turn work through a MEMOIZING handler in `intake._answer_with_ask`: it raises
`_NeedVerdict` on each new (subj, rel, obj), we yield the ask, record the verdict, and re-enter `ask_goal`,
which now answers that tuple from the memo and raises on the next unmet premise — converging monotonically
(the graph is the continuation). Only fires when the goal was NOT already derivable (a derivable goal pays
no extra closure); never asks the goal or negative tuples (those stay the existing top-level OWA gather).
`tests/test_isa_stream.py` (+5). REMAINING: extend the gather to who/∃/n-ary questions (v1 = the yes/no-bound
path, the common case) and lazy relevance-ordered asking instead of the eager frontier.

### Phase 8.5b: per-emit reasoning-trace streaming (`trace=True`) (296 passed)
`ingest`/`converse(trace=True)` now stream an `Event("derive", {rule, fact})` per rule firing before the
answer — the reasoning trace as a live event stream (`docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §5: "the meta-debug trace
renderer IS the event stream"). Implementation reads the RECORD/provenance substrate rather than hooking
the reasoning control flow: the demand chain runs with `provenance=True` (which already mints `<j:RULEKEY>`
justification nodes with proves/uses), and intake snapshots the `<j:>` node set before/after the closure
(`_derivations_since`), rendering each NEW justification's proven fact + rule via `provenance.py` +
`surface.render_relation`. So it is a pure OBSERVER — no `chain_sip`/`check` control-flow change, no
perturbation of reasoning. `ask_goal` gained a `provenance` param threaded to its check/chain_sip calls.
Additive: `trace=False` default = behaviour-identical. `tests/test_isa_stream.py` (+3: blocking trace order
/ trace-off neutral / converse trace). Trace is BUFFERED per turn (derivations yielded after the closure
returns — ordered, not wall-clock-interleaved). REMAINING in 8.5b: true wall-clock interleaving (a live
`_record` callback needs coroutine reasoning — the generator can't yield from inside the synchronous
chain) + mid-CHAIN ask (v1 wait-set is the TOP goal only; the re-entry resume model doesn't cleanly extend
to multiple ask points). Both are engine-deep and deferred.

### Phase 8.6: runtime-rule DISABLE via `<disabled>` marker — 8.6 functionally complete (293 passed)
`forget that rule` / `disable that rule` marks the LAST-AUTHORED rule `<disabled>` (`docs/cnl_intake_design.md`
§6), completing the rule-authoring lifecycle: add / conflict-negotiate / disable. It is an additive
control-layer MARKER, never a deletion (§5) — the `Rule` object stays in the theory list; only which rules
are ACTIVE changes. New module `ugm/rule_control.py` mirrors `focus.py`: `<disabled>`/`<last-rule>` control
hubs pointing at nodes named by rule key; `RULE_FORMS` recognized as a FORM (§D.2, not string-sniffed) and
checked BEFORE the focus forms — `forget that rule` is a MORE SPECIFIC form than the focus `forget that`
(the trailing `rule` token disambiguates, grammar precedence). `active_rules(kb, rules)` = theory minus
disabled, applied at BOTH question-answering and the conflict trial, so a disabled rule neither fires nor
cycles. "that rule" = the last add — the discourse referent, the parallel of focus's `forget that` = the
current frame. SEMANTIC (a test surfaces it): disable stops FUTURE derivations; a conclusion an earlier
query already MATERIALIZED persists (monotone, §5 no retraction) — disabling is not retraction. Intake:
`recognize_rule_op` route (before focus), `mark_last_added` on rule commit, `active_rules` at answer/lint,
`Outcome.disabled_keys` + `Event("rule-disable")`. `tests/test_isa_intake.py` (+3). REMAINING in 8.6:
incremental head-index extend only (a PERF follow-on — `_reify_rules` rebuilds per `ask_goal`, so a
new/disabled rule already takes effect immediately). **8.6 is functionally complete.**

### Phase 8.6: runtime-rule conflict-lint AS CONVERSATION (290 passed)
A mid-session `HEAD when …` that forms a NEGATION CYCLE with the live theory is now a conversation, not a
crash (`docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §6 — critique §3.3's "the reasoner negotiates its own repair"). Intake
parses the rule with `load_rules(lint=False)` (runtime authoring OWNS the stratification check now, instead
of `load_rules` raising), tests a TRIAL `rules + new` with `_stratify_conflict` (the content-blind
`authoring.stratify`, no relation name special-cased), and on a cycle YIELDS `Event("rule-conflict",
{detail})` through the same §5 ask channel as `ask_user`. A falsey verdict REJECTS the rule (discarded —
the trial list means `rules` is never mutated on reject, which also fixes the old rule-route bug where
`rules.extend` ran BEFORE the lint and left a rejected rule in the list); a truthy verdict ACCEPTS it
(committed; `run_rules` degrades the NAF rules per the `on_cycle` stance). Blocking `ingest` grows an
`on_conflict(detail)->bool` handler defaulting to a SAFE REJECT when unwired (never silently admit a cycle,
never crash); `converse` yields the event for the caller to `.send()`. Per-add re-lint now rides this one
check (the separate `lint_stratifiable` raise in the rule route is gone). `tests/test_isa_intake.py` (+3)
+ `tests/test_isa_stream.py` (+1). REMAINING in 8.6: the DISABLE `<disabled>` marker + its "forget that
rule" control-CNL (reification skips a disabled rule, no deletion §5), and incremental head-index extend
(a PERF follow-on — a new rule already reasons immediately since `_reify_rules` rebuilds per `ask_goal`).

### Phase 8.5b: `converse` — threadless generator driver with ask suspend/resume (286 passed)
The non-blocking driver for the TUI (`docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §5). `ingest`'s body was refactored into a
generator routing CORE `_ingest_gen` that yields an `Event` per step boundary and returns the `Outcome`;
TWO thin drivers ride it — `ingest` (blocking, 8.5a, byte-identical: forwards events to `on_event`, calls
`ask_user` synchronously) and the new `converse(kb, rules, utt)` (non-blocking generator the caller pumps
with `.send()`). Suspend/resume needs NO threads and NO async rewrite of the engine: the ask wait-point
raises an internal `_NeedVerdict` that unwinds the demand chain cleanly (graph state persists, monotone
§5-safe); the driver yields `Event("ask", …)`, the caller `.send()`s the verdict (True/False/None), and
RESUME re-enters `ask_goal` with that verdict as a one-shot handler — "the graph is the continuation," so
the demand chain prunes-and-continues (the one extra re-entry `check` is the accepted §5 perf follow-on).
ZERO engine changes — `query.py`/`check.py`/`chain.py` untouched; the whole mechanism lives in intake.
`tests/test_isa_stream.py` +3 (question→answer; suspend-at-ask→send-True→materialize→re-ask-needs-no-gather;
verdict no/unknown). REMAINING in 8.5b: PER-EMIT reasoning-trace streaming (surface `run_bank(provenance=
True)`'s `<j:>` firings live) + mid-CHAIN ask (v1 wait-set is `{ask_user}` at the TOP goal only).

### Phase 8 client build: unified intake + discourse focus stack (273 passed)
Kicked off the first UGM CLIENT (agent loop + TUI) per `docs/cnl_intake_design.md`. Landed:
- **8.1 unified intake** (`ugm/intake.py`) — `ingest(kb, rules, utterance) -> Outcome` routes fact / rule /
  question / focus / unrecognized by WHICH FORMS FIRE (not a string sniff, §D discipline), reusing
  `recognize`/`ask_goal`/`load_rules`/`load_facts`. A mid-session rule reasons immediately (8.6 seed);
  gibberish → the habitability rejection. Removes the caller-side question-vs-assert fork at the entry.
- **8.3a focus stack** (`ugm/focus.py`) — the working set as a `<focus>` STACK in the control layer, each
  frame pointing at CENTER entity nodes; extent DERIVED, not a declared scope. Implicit WIDEN-ONLY on
  assert (`utterance_subjects`, content-blind); explicit control-CNL `focus on X` / `forget that` /
  `back to X` recognized as `FOCUS_FORMS` (not string-sniffed); drop/re-enter are control-layer ops (§5:
  entities persist, only the pointer is cut). Answer-neutral (focus is tracked; reasoning still whole-graph
  — seed-from-focus is 8.3b).
- **8.2 groundwork** — `tokenize(..., control=True)`; 8.2 folded into 8.3 (a live `<query>` has no consumer
  but focus, which governs its GC — the transplant lands there).
- **8.3a remainder** — questions widen focus too; spent token-chain scaffolding GC'd per utterance
  (`focus.gc_utterance_scaffolding`, answer-neutral).
- **8.3b seed-from-focus** — BOUNDED ATTENTION, exposed + caller-selected (`focus_scope` threaded through
  `chain_sip`/`_facts_matching`/`check`/`ask_goal`; `ingest(attention="global"|"focus")`). A fact is
  visible iff an endpoint is in the focus working set; default = whole-graph (278 suite green). PROBE — a
  bound `is s<k>_0 thief` as independent cases accrete: GLOBAL 0.5s→5.5s→31s→112s (super-linear session-
  accretion cliff, the coref fan-out over the whole KB); FOCUS 23→29→65→83ms (FLAT); ratio 23×→1361×.
  Per-utterance cost now tracks the focus, not the session — the accretion fix validated. SEMANTIC: off-
  focus facts leave attention (agent-not-theorem-prover), so answers can differ from global by design.
- **8.4a anaphora — tried then BACKED OUT (2026-07-12).** An in-substrate bare-pronoun resolver (resolve
  "she" against a recency-ranked `focus.salient_center`, `clarify` on no antecedent) was landed, then removed
  by ratified decision: anaphora is a BOUNDARY concern the external SLM owns via the exposed `focus.top_centers`
  — it buys nothing structural (reasoning is byte-identical for "she" vs "ada"), it is NL pragmatics off the
  substrate's mission. `salient_center`/recency-ranking/`clarify` deleted; `focus`/`top_centers` stay. Bonus:
  `focus.utterance_subjects` now skips coref `same_as` edges so a TYPE can't leak into the centers as a
  stopword-anchor. Descriptive anaphora + substrate ask-margin (was 8.4b) dropped for the same reason. See
  `docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §4.
- **8.5a live event stream** — `ingest(on_event=…)` emits `Event(kind, data)` at route boundaries (focus/
  clarify/question/ask/answer/fact/rule/unrecognized) so a TUI renders a turn live; the `ask` event brackets
  the human-in-the-loop `ask_user` gather. Additive (`on_event=None` = no-op). `tests/test_isa_stream.py` (4).
Discipline: `docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §D (7 anti-hardcoding rules) documented + mirrored in the plan's
Phase 8 header. `tests/test_isa_intake.py` (6) + `tests/test_isa_focus.py` (20) + `tests/test_isa_stream.py`
(4). 283 suite green (after the 8.4a back-out).

### NAC existence check made ENDPOINT-DRIVEN — 40× on the NAF hot path (258 passed, suite 54s→35s)
Phase 8.0 probe (`bench/session_accretion.py`, `docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §7) found the agent-loop client's
real near-term blocker is NOT session accretion but PER-UTTERANCE NAF cost: a *bound* query on a bank with
one `not …` rule was super-linear in the bank's entity count — `is s0 thief` over 6 suspects took 13.8s.
cProfile named it: the NAC check `_nac_blocks -> _fact_exists -> apply._find_fact_relnode` did a
WHOLE-PREDICATE scan (`_fact_relnodes` / `nodes_with_key(pred)`, 8.7M calls), which grows with the whole
bank for a high-frequency predicate like the copula `is`. Perf-lever-(a) had made `chain._facts_matching`
endpoint-driven but never touched this NAC-path reader. FIX: `_find_fact_relnode` now walks the SUBJECT's
local topology (`rel in g.succ(s)` == `s in g.pred(rel)`; both endpoints are bound node ids in an
existence check), O(degree(s)) instead of O(#pred-facts), with the exact `_fact_relnodes` per-rel filter —
behaviour-identical. Result: m=6 13.8s→0.34s (40×); whole suite 258 green (no change) and 54s→35s.
RESIDUAL super-linearity (m=12 still 5.5s) is levers (b) agenda re-servicing + (c) coref `same_as` demand
fan-out — the profile is now flat (breadth, no hot spot); seed-from-focus (Phase 8.3) will bound the coref
fan-out by scoping, so it is addressed by the client build rather than a separate perf push.

### Pre-firmware-v3 leftovers RETIRED — demand/coref/walk/asp deleted (258 passed, 0 failed)
The superseded demand/coref/walk Python subsystems the audit flagged are gone (user-directed; harneskills,
the only cross-repo consumer, is being adapted onto the new engine docs). DELETED: `ugm/demand.py`
(`DEMAND_TRANSITIVITY`/`DEMAND_COREF`/`seed_demand` — the pre-v3 magic-set transitivity/coref rules, now
done by `chain_sip` + reified `R is transitive`), `ugm/coref_walk.py` (`resolve_coref` cursor walk —
firmware-v3 coref is `same_as_rules` demanded by the chain; load-time `authoring._coref_propagation`
stays), `ugm/cnl/walker.py` (`walk_on_demand` + the WALK mode's fuelled traversal — subsumed by
demand-driven CHAIN over declared-transitive relations), `ugm/asp.py` + the `[asp]`/clingo optional
extra. Plus `corpus/walker.cnl`, the three dedicated test files (`test_asp_calc`, `test_coref_walk`,
`test_walkers`), the walker/demand benches (`bench/wordnet_messy.py`, `bench/wordnet_scaling.py`), and
the walker/demand/coref test functions in `test_machine_rules`/`test_new_core`. `ugm/__init__.py` unwired
(imports + `__all__`, including a stale `"decide"` entry left from the Phase-6.1 deletion). Import +
`from ugm import *` clean; suite 283→258 (−25 tests, all for deleted code), 0 failed. No LIVE firmware
path depended on any of them (verified: only `__init__` re-exports + tests/benches). As-built:
`docs/architecture.md` module-map note.

### Firmware STANCE as declared data + pluggable tools + the three engine docs (283 passed, 1 skipped)
The firmware's OPINIONATED stances are now SELECTABLE DATA, not forked Python — the substrate + engine
stay generic, a different firmware activates by swapping a policy object (user-directed). What landed:

- **`ugm/policy.py` — `FirmwarePolicy`.** Two stances as one immutable declared object: `negation_default`
  (`"closed"` CWA — the shipped default, `open_preds` are OWA exceptions / `"open"` OWA, `closed_preds`
  are CWA exceptions; `is_open(concept)` reads it) and `on_cycle` (`"raise"` reject a non-stratifiable
  bank at load / `"degrade"` defer to `run_rules`, which drops the NAF rules). `DEFAULT_POLICY` == today's
  behaviour, so passing nothing is behaviour-neutral. Wired through `check` / `query.ask_goal` /
  `mode_calls` (negation stance) and `load_rules` / `load_corpus` (on_cycle). The legacy `open_preds=`
  kwarg still works (folds into a closed-world policy). `tests/test_isa_policy.py` (9 tests: the OWA flip,
  per-concept exceptions, on_cycle raise-vs-degrade, `merge_tools` collision).
- **`dispatch.merge_tools(*registries)`** — collision-safe tool-registry composition (raises on a name
  clash) so a consumer (harneskills) layers its own tools onto the firmware's without silent shadowing.
  The tool mechanism itself was already pluggable (`dict[str, Tool]` → `run_bank`/`service_calls`); this
  is the ergonomics + the documented contract, NOT a redesign (the §8 discipline was already correct).
- **Three engine docs.** `docs/architecture.md` (the as-built generic→opinionated layering: substrate →
  engine/ISA → tools → reified rules → firmware → stance → CNL; the generic/opinionated seam; module
  map — this is Phase 6.2's architecture half), `docs/engine_developer_guide.md` (the extension points:
  a bank, a tool, the stance, a whole firmware, a new ISA instruction — each with a worked example + the
  discipline), `docs/engine_user_guide.md` (consuming UGM: load, ask, stance, ask_user, tools, forward
  snapshot). README reread + de-staled (removed dead `decide.py`/`rewriter.py`/`is_not`-completion
  references, fixed the `ask`/`check` signatures and the "No embeddings" contradiction, added an
  Architecture section + layer diagram + doc links). All doc examples smoke-tested.

### Demand-driven-negation perf — ENDPOINT-DRIVEN `_facts_matching` (274 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
Plan item 0' (the honest weak spot named after firmware v3), lever (a). The bound-tuple fact reader
`chain._facts_matching` no longer scans every fact for the predicate: when a demand carries a bound
endpoint (which SIP makes almost always true), it reaches the matching facts THROUGH that endpoint's
node — the bound name resolves to candidate nodes via the `name` value-accelerator (`nodes_named`, a
candidate SET to test, never identity, so the label-less discipline holds), then local `succ`/`pred`
topology over the 2-hop reification gives the `(pred,subj)`/`(pred,obj)` facts directly. A new
`_rel_matches_pred` helper carries the per-rel visibility half of `_fact_relnodes` (keyed, non-inert,
control only as the active SUPPOSE-scope pencil), so the endpoint-driven paths are BEHAVIOUR-IDENTICAL
to the old whole-predicate scan; that scan stays only as the fallback for a fully-unbound demand.
No new index structure — the existing `name` index + topology. Result (identical answers, gated by the
whole suite + the NAF differential): under cProfile at 12 suspects/6 aliases (wildcard `who is thief`)
6.18s→0.565s, call count 9.9M→0.98M; the full suite ~90s→~54s; the old top-of-profile `_endpoints`/`name`
linear scans are gone. As-built: `docs/demand_driven_negation_design.md` AS-BUILT §6. The other item-0'
levers (semi-naive worklist; coref demand fan-out) are un-started — at session scale the query is now
sub-second, so they stay Phase 7.

## 2026-07-11

### Firmware v3 — DEMAND-DRIVEN NEGATION; forward `decide.solve` DELETED (274 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
Negation is now decided ON DEMAND by negation-as-failure, not by eager forward completion + defeat. The
model (ratified): we are a bounded reasoning AGENT, not a theorem prover — a human decides a negation by
ASKING the positive when the question comes up and taking absence as the answer (CWA), never by
completing every `is_not` then retracting. Design + as-built (with the deviations that matter):
`docs/demand_driven_negation_design.md`. Both §Crux ratified the aggressive way ([[demand-negation-crux]]):
drop `decide.solve` ENTIRELY (no `materialize` helper), fold `ask` into `ask_goal`. What landed:

- **NAF in `chain_sip` (`_nac_blocks`).** A rule-body NAC `not L` is serviced by a NESTED NEGATIVE
  DEMAND: bind it, demand the positive `L` to CLOSURE (a self-contained nested `chain_sip`), read
  ABSENCE. Nothing is materialized for the negative — the verdict is computed from the empty demand
  closure, the same move CHECK makes at top level, pushed inside the rule body. `tests/test_isa_naf.py`.
- **Fuel → UNKNOWN.** A shared `_Exhaustion` flag bubbles up when any closure hits its round budget
  short of fixpoint; `check.py` reads it to return UNKNOWN ("didn't finish looking") vs a decided
  ASSUMED_NO. The agent-not-theorem-prover payoff the forward exhaustive model cannot express.
- **Stratification at LOAD, prune-and-continue at runtime.** The object-aware `authoring.lint_stratifiable`
  is the arbiter (accepts THIEF, rejects `p:-¬q, q:-¬p`). A runtime ground-goal cycle guard fires
  SPURIOUSLY on stratifiable banks (a coref rule's wildcard `is(x,?)` demand pulls in a higher-stratum
  `is`-producer whose NAC re-demands the negative), so the chain PRUNES the re-entered higher-stratum
  rule and continues — sound under the load-time guarantee. See design AS-BUILT §1.
- **`ask_goal` flipped to demand-driven; `ask` is now pure rendering.** yes/no via `check`, who via
  `chain_sip`, why via a provenance demand + `explain`. No forward materialize-then-read.
- **`expand_rules` stops upgrading closed-world NACs.** Every `not P` clause reflects to a plain NAC
  decided on demand; NO `is_not` upgrade, NO generated completion rule. The `cleared is closed world`
  marker is now vestigial for reasoning (open/closed is a query-time concern via `open_preds`).
- **DELETED `ugm/decide.py`** (completion_rule / DEFEAT_SEED / solve / closed_predicates / …) and
  `tests/test_decide.py`. The step-4 differential (demand-driven == forward `decide.solve` on THIEF +
  serve-regular) was green BEFORE deletion — that earned the retirement; it now pins the demand-driven
  answers (`tests/test_isa_naf_differential.py`). Migrated `test_riddles`/`test_contract`/`test_isa_ask`
  onto `ask_goal` and the NAF trace shape (no `is_not`/`complete` premise; the elimination is absence).
- **Graded α-cut reified into the chain** (`rule_graph.write_rule` + `chain._graded_ok`) — forced so
  graded banks (ICE_CREAM's `is very urgent`) don't regress; the graded filter was otherwise dropped.
- **Perf: NAC-closure MEMO (~17×)** + local-agenda drive (no `bound_demands` scan in the hot path). A
  wildcard "who is thief" went 129s→7.5s; the suite 26min→90s. Deeper perf (coref-demand fan-out,
  linear fact scans → indexing/semi-naive) is Phase 7. See design AS-BUILT §2.

### Phase 6.1 — GoalSolver + reference Walker DELETED; ONE firmware engine; decided-negation-only (264 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
The second reasoning engine is gone. Design + as-built: `docs/goalsolver_retirement_design.md`. Ratified
by the user ("nuke the old code — it caused at least 3 refactors from things we forgot"; keep GoalSolver
only as a throwaway differential oracle, delete the moment it hinders, "I don't care about reds"). See
[[delete-old-code-aggressively]]. What landed:

- **`ask_goal` flipped onto the FORWARD firmware.** `cnl/query.ask_goal` was the last production consumer
  of `GoalSolver`; it now runs `decide.solve(graph, rules)` (decided negation) + reads the materialized
  graph via `match_pats` — the same forward ISA engine (`run_bank`) everything else uses. KEY REALIZATION
  (from a hazard test): the monotone demand-driven chain (`chain`/`check`) CANNOT do decided negation —
  its aggressive completion re-fires without the defeat (which is an INTERPOSE retraction, non-monotone).
  Decided negation is inherently FORWARD (complete-for-all, then defeat), and `run_bank` already stratifies
  + services INTERPOSE, so the forward path is correct where the demand-driven one isn't. The demand-driven
  selectivity was GoalSolver's and is deliberately given up (session-scale, forward is ~ms).
- **`decide.solve` de-Python-ed.** Its two-phase Python `if` (run domain+completion; if a `<retract>` was
  seeded, run RETRACT_RULES with provenance off) collapsed to a SINGLE stratified `run_rules` pass over
  `[*rules, DEFEAT_SEED, *RETRACT_RULES]` — the ordering the phase-split enforced by hand is emergent from
  stratification; RETRACT_RULES are no-ops when nothing is seeded. No Python control flow left.
- **DELETED:** `ugm/goal.py` (GoalSolver, Goal, solve_goal, solve_all, NonStratifiable) and `ugm/walker.py`
  (the Python reference `Walker` / `walk_to_goal` — its only consumer was GoalSolver; the in-graph
  `cnl/walker.walk_on_demand` is the real walker and STAYS). ~79 tests removed with them (12 test files:
  `test_isa_walker`, 9×`test_isa_goal_*`, `test_isa_firmware_gate` [the firmware==GoalSolver differential],
  `test_isa_forward` [the `solve_all` tests]); the surviving mixed files re-targeted onto the firmware
  (`solve_all`→`run_rules`/`decide.solve`; the coref-composition and check-verdict differentials now gate
  the demand-driven firmware against forward materialization instead of against GoalSolver).
- **Decided-negation-only.** The `decided_negation=False` NAF path (keep `is not P` a NAC for GoalSolver to
  complete) is RETIRED — the parameter is removed from `expand_rules`/`load_corpus`/`_expand_rule_node`;
  a closed-world `is not P` is ALWAYS upgraded to a positive `is_not` match + completion rule. Ordinary
  (non-closed-world) structural NAC guards (e.g. `is_a.transitive`'s idempotency NAC) are unaffected —
  those are not epistemic negation.

### Phase 2.5 — substrate vocabulary consolidated, domain coref de-hardcoded (342 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
The logic-fragment predicate strings that were scattered/duplicated across the reasoning modules are now a
single source of truth, and the hardcoded DOMAIN predicate list is gone. Design doc:
`docs/vocabulary_declaration_design.md`; **crux §7 ratified by the user: "consolidate"** (Tier 1 is fixed
substrate vocabulary to centralize, NOT genuinely KB-declared — a KB no more declares its copula than its
`same_as`). Three-tier boundary from the design, executed:

- **Tier 1 — new leaf module `ugm/vocabulary.py`** holds the fixed substrate tokens ONCE: `COPULA`/
  `NEG_COPULA`/`NEG_SUFFIX`/`IS_A`/`IS_A_NOT`/`SAME_AS`/`DISJOINT`/`CLOSES`/`CWA`/`REL_PROPERTY`/
  `TRANSITIVE`/`EVERY_IS_A`/`IS_UNIQUE`/`TARGET`/`TYPE`, plus `neg_pred()` (the single `R`→`R_not`
  convention) and `SUBSTRATE_COREF_PREDS`. Stdlib-only leaf (no intra-package imports → no cycle). The
  duplicate `COPULA="is"` (was defined 4×: `decide`/`goal`/`check`/`query`), `NEG_COPULA`/`NEG_SUFFIX`,
  `CWA`/`CLOSES`, and the two independent `_neg_pred` bodies now all import from `vocabulary`; `decide`
  re-exports them so `decide.COPULA`/… stay valid. Reasoning-side literals folded too (`goal`'s
  `nodes_with_key("same_as")` + mid-solve `rel == "same_as"`; `demand`'s `is_a` transitivity rules;
  `coref_walk`'s `SAME_AS`/`IS_A`/`DISJOINT`; `universal`'s `same_as_rules`/`entailed_negation_rules`/
  `UNIVERSAL_RULES`). Exit-gate check: no substrate constant is DEFINED outside `vocabulary.py`, and the
  reasoning modules (`goal`/`decide`/`check`/`demand`/`coref_walk`) are grep-clean of the vocab literals.

- **Tier 2 — domain coref predicates de-hardcoded (the real leak).** `authoring._COREF_PREDS` (the moved
  `session.CONTENT_PREDS`, 5.4b residual **B**) hardcoded `wants`/`in`/`has`/`before`/`target`/`type`
  alongside the substrate ones. `_coref_propagation` now derives its predicate set content-blind from
  three sources — `SUBSTRATE_COREF_PREDS | relation_predicates(graph) | declared_relations | declared_
  prepositions` — naming NO domain vocabulary. Using the pre-existing `relation_predicates(graph)`
  ("every relation predicate in play") is the faithful additive-coref analog: the destructive merge
  shared ALL of a mention's relations, so coref must too. This also correctly handles the default-grammar
  predicates (`in`/`has`/`before` come from built-in surface forms `form.of`/`form.has`/`form.then`, not
  a KB declaration — so a "declared-relations-only" set would have dropped them). Verified: dropping the
  hardcoded list first regressed exactly two tests (`test_isa_ask` CWA elimination, `test_new_core`
  defeasible placement — both needing `in` to compose across coref, the "one or two surfacings" the
  design predicted); the `relation_predicates` union fixes both because `in` is materialized before
  `_coref_propagation` reads the graph.

- **Tier 3 — CNL surface English lexicon (`forms.py` `form.*`, `DEFAULT_COPULA_SYNONYMS`) STAYS** literal
  by design (recognizing English is the surface's job); untouched.

Pairs with Phase 5.5 slice 4 (which did the plan-control-flow half of the `solve.py` predicate leak);
this is the vocabulary half. `docs/vocabulary_declaration_design.md` updated to as-built.

### Phase 2.4 — name-free identity tokens (342 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
`GoalSolver`'s coref-class identity token was `name + SEP + classrep` (SEP = `\x00`) — the surface name
baked into the internal identity string. Phase 2.4 drops the redundant name prefix: an identity token is
now `SEP + classrep-nid`, keyed ONLY by the class-representative node id; the name is recovered from that
node via `ag.name(rep)` in `_render` (the output-boundary rendering the plan asks for), not carried in
the token. The Skolem/value-invention token likewise becomes `SEP + fresh-nid` (was `name + SEP + skN`),
which also makes it naturally consistent with `_token(nid)`'s recomputation instead of relying on the
cache. SEP stays the discriminator between an IDENTITY token (entity, exact match) and a plain NAME
(concept/literal, name match) — a control char never in a surface name, so the split is robust.

Entirely contained to `goal.py` (SEP/`_token`/`_render` never escaped it — verified across the package).
Changed: `_token`, `_render`, `_invalidate_class` (class token IS `SEP+rep` now, so exact-match not
endswith), the Skolem mint. The unique-name case (token == name, a 1:1 stable identity) and the
concept/literal name-matching path are unchanged — a unique name legitimately IS its identity. Gated by
the coref/adversarial suite (two-Pauls-stay-separate, same_as-composes, mid-solve union visibility) plus
a new pin `test_duplicated_name_identity_token_is_name_free` (asserts the token equals `SEP + rep`,
contains no surface name, and still renders + denotes the whole class). Unblocked by Phase 2.3.

### Phase 2.3 — `name` demoted, discriminating-key indexes, `TEMPORARY BRIDGE` retired (341 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
The load-bearing `TEMPORARY BRIDGE` (a relation node's predicate stored BOTH as its graded key `{chase:1.0}`
AND as a legacy VALUED `name="chase"`) is gone. Design doc: `docs/name_demotion_design.md` (ratified +
implemented same day). Two halves, both landed:

- **(A) Predicate decoupling.** A relation's predicate is now SOLELY its graded key. New accessor
  `AttrGraph.predicate(rid)` = the rel node's single non-reserved, non-`confidence` graded key. Migrated
  the central reader `derived_triples` (identify a relation by its predicate key, not "has a VALUED name")
  and `MINT.dedup` (match on the key, not `attrs[NAME]`); dropped the three bridge writes (`add_relation`,
  `lowering.lower_rhs`, `lowering.to_attrgraph`). `AttrGraph.name()` / `AttrNode.name` now require the
  attr be VALUED, so a relation whose predicate is literally `name` (`{name:1.0}` graded) reports no
  entity name — which also **retires the old reserved-key-collision special case** (a `name` predicate is
  now sound, distinct in KIND from an entity's VALUED `{name:"Paul"}`). Control-ness-at-mint for a `<…>`
  relation predicate is preserved explicitly in `add_relation` (the dict form of `add_node` doesn't
  auto-flag). ~85 `g.name(rel)` predicate readers swept to `predicate()`/`has_key()` across the engine +
  CNL surface; plus reader classes the plain `.name(` grep missed and the design flagged as risks:
  `walker._successors`' `get_attr(r,"name")==rel`, and the `nodes_named(PREDICATE)` relation-finders in
  `goal._closure_declarations`, `mode_calls.choice_results`, `provenance.derived_facts`/`axiomatize`
  (→ `nodes_with_key`). `bench/coverage_audit._relation_exists`/`_hazards` migrated too.
- **(B) Discriminating-key indexes.** The single hardcoded `_by_name` value-accelerator is generalized to
  `_by_value[key]` maintained for DECLARED keys only (`indexed_keys`, default `{"name"}`); `name` is now
  an ORDINARY declared index, not a privileged `if key == NAME` path. New API: `declare_index(key)`
  (back-fills), `nodes_with_value(key, val)`, `value_count(key, val)` — all candidate-set, never
  resolving (the label-less guarantee holds). `nodes_named`/`name_count` are thin wrappers over the `name`
  key. A KB may now declare additional discriminating keys.
- **Bonus correctness — garbage triples gone.** `derived_triples`' old "has a VALUED name + in/out edges"
  test mis-identified ENTITY nodes that happened to sit between two relations as relations, emitting
  spurious triples (e.g. `("fast","vanilla","in_stock")` from the entity `vanilla`). The predicate-key
  test is exact, so those artifacts vanish; several test expectations were corrected to the true relation
  sets (`test_isa_lowering`, `test_isa_reasoning_parity`).
- **Sequencing note.** This was the keystone: it unblocks 2.4 (name-free identity), and settles the
  name/key/value model so Phase 7(a) interns a clean representation rather than the bridged one. The
  interning hazard behind the key-aware INTERN guard (`machine.py`) is now structurally impossible — a
  domain relation carries no valued name, so `nodes_named` can never return one.

### Phase 5.5 slice 3c — SUPPOSE authored as a `<call>` mode (variable-length args) (341 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
CHECK/CHOOSE (slices 1–2) are fixed-slot `<call>`s; SUPPOSE could not be — a hypothesis carries a
VARIABLE-LENGTH list of assumptions and predictions, so slice 2 deliberately left it out of the registry.
Slice 3c supplies the list-argument encoding and closes the mode-call trio.

- **`mode_calls.suppose_tool`** (registered in `mode_registry` now): a `<call> --tool--> suppose` carries
  any number of `assume`/`predict` REIFIED TRIPLES (`<t> -[k_subj/k_pred/k_obj]-> …`, the machine-rule
  clause vocabulary). The tool decodes them, runs the firmware `suppose` (mint `<hypothesis>` scope →
  pencil the assumptions → CHAIN+CHECK the predictions in-scope → CONFIRM→ink / REFUTE|INCONCLUSIVE→drop),
  and folds a `<suppose>` verdict node back — same two-view shape as `<check>` (VALUED `status`/`of` for
  the Python reader `suppose_results`; a control `status` relation + optional `of -> LABEL` for a
  downstream rule to react). `suppose` leaves NO live scope, so it composes into the `<call>` loop exactly
  like CHECK: CONFIRM's committed ink is re-matched by `run_bank`'s next round. The (subj,pred,obj) vs
  (pred,subj,obj) ordering quirk between `suppose`'s assumption/prediction args is hidden in the tool —
  the author writes `k_subj/k_pred/k_obj` uniformly.
- **Authored via the EXISTING machine-rule grammar** (the 3a/3b ratification: reuse the `<call>` grammar,
  no new prose forms, zero SLM debt). A prose `suppose … predict …` sugar that folds to this reified
  encoding is a tracked follow-on, deferred like the `to NAME` header.
- **`tests/test_isa_suppose_calls.py` (6):** all three verdicts reproduce the direct `suppose(...)` (incl.
  CONFIRM's ink commit surviving teardown and REFUTE/INCONCLUSIVE leaving ink untouched), the verdict is a
  control token, a single call carries MULTIPLE assumptions + predictions, and a CNL-authored rule emits
  the call whose fed-back verdict drives a downstream rule. Test-authoring note logged: a reified-triple
  slot must mint FRESH name-carrying nodes (not `nodes_named`, which aliases a live predicate rel node —
  the same interning hazard the machine-rule path avoids via the 3b key-aware INTERN fix); the tool reads
  only names and `suppose` re-resolves entities, so fresh is sound.

### Phase 5.5 slice 4 — plan→act→check→replan as declared data; `solve.py` retired (335 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
`solve.py`'s `run_to_goal` held the plan-execution control flow in a Python `for _ in range(max_cycles)`
loop that hardcoded predicate NAMES straight into the branches (`graph.name(r) == "want"/"add"/"chosen"/
"ready"/"done"`) — the standing-rule violation ("domain logic ONLY in banks; strategies are DECLARED
data, never engine sniffing"), the same shape-sniffing anti-pattern Phase 5.4 eliminated for the
walker/coref strategies. Slice 4 retires that driver.

- **The whole loop is now DATA.** `tests/test_isa_plan_act_check.py` (4 tests) demonstrates
  plan→act→check→replan as a handful of forward rules serviced by the EXISTING `<call>` loop
  (`run_bank(..., tools=mode_registry(rule_g))`, `mode_calls.py`) — no new driver, no Python control
  flow, no predicate name baked into engine code. Each control-flow element `run_to_goal` hardcoded is
  now a rule (or a §8 CALL), exactly `processing_modes.md` §3's "ITERATE over the expected-effect list ×
  CHECK each against observed": ACT (`_perform_op`/`simulate_effects`) → an `act` CALL (the world
  boundary, composed into the same registry as the firmware modes); CHECK (`goal_satisfied`/`_diverged`)
  → a CHECK CALL per want whose `<check>` verdict feeds back as matchable control relations; REPLAN
  (`_replan`'s driver-state reset) → a rule that commits an alternative op on a divergence.
- **No teardown needed — the monotone substrate subsumes the driver-state reset.** Because each op's
  CHECK is fired-suppressed per (op, want), an alternative op contributes its OWN positive verdict
  independently of the diverged op's stale assumed-no verdict; nothing is torn down (the stale verdict
  is control, fact-invisible). This is the same subsumption Phase 2/3 found for `DROP_CTRL`/
  `planning_teardown.cnl`, now for the entire replan machinery — `run_to_goal`'s reset is Python
  machinery the substrate makes unnecessary. The derived-effect bridge (`run_to_goal`'s one integration
  point, `_observe_simulated`'s base + DERIVED adds) is covered: CHECK resolves a want observed only via
  a rule-bank derivation through the same CHAIN the whole firmware uses.
- **`solve.py` deleted** (`derive_plan`/`run_to_goal`/`Plan`/`DEFAULT_TOOLS`/`rank_cheaper_than`
  dropped from `ugm/__init__.py` exports). Within `ugm` it was export-only — never used internally;
  its solving MECHANISM was always ISA-native `GoalSolver` (not a second engine like `rewriter.py`), so
  this is an undeclared-strategy retirement, not a repo-boundary move. The STRIPS-flavored planning
  banks + card-trader stress case are harness content (they live in `harneskills` as an APPLICATION of
  this generic mechanism); the `harneskills`-side `from ugm import run_to_goal` consumers migrate onto
  the declared composition separately (cross-repo, user-owned). Pairs with the still-open Phase 2.5
  ("`solve.py`'s predicate list → KB declarations") — that was the VOCABULARY half; this was the
  CONTROL-FLOW half.

### Repo-split test-suite cleanup — purge carried-over harness-only tests (337 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed)
This repo is a fresh carveout of the `ugm` engine from the `harneskills` monorepo. Running the full
suite post-carveout found **117 failing tests (of 460)** that referenced harness-only content which
should never have been carried over: `SOLVE_RULES`/`PLANNING_RULES`/`REQUEST_RULES`/`TEARDOWN_RULES`
rule banks, `Session`, and mechanism/CPG banks — none of which exist in this repo (equivalents already
live in `harneskills/tests/`).

- **Two wholly harness-only test files deleted**: `tests/test_verb_catalog.py`, `tests/test_existentials.py`
  (every test in each depended on harness-only surface, nothing severable).
- **Seven mixed files trimmed**, removing only the harness-scoped failing test functions and keeping
  every test that was passing (99 functions removed total): `tests/test_new_core.py`,
  `tests/test_universals.py`, `tests/test_code_frames.py`, `tests/test_contract.py`,
  `tests/test_coverage_audit.py`, `tests/test_isa_ask.py`, `tests/test_machine_rules.py`.
- **Confirmed** `examples/ice_cream.py`, referenced by one of the removed tests, is legitimately
  harness-only (it exists in `harneskills/examples/`, not in this repo) — not a carveout omission.

Result: full suite green — **337 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.

### Test-suite hygiene follow-up — orphaned helpers/section-headers from the trim above
The bulk removal above left dead code behind in the surviving files: helper functions only called by
the deleted tests, and section-comment banners with nothing left under them. Swept by hand: 8 orphaned
helpers deleted from `test_new_core.py` (`_coffee`, `_coffee_ext`, `_coffee_two_water`, `_current_prices`,
`_edges`, `_event_roles`, `_record`, `_teardown_replan`), plus one from `test_isa_ask.py` (`_entail_bank`);
9 now-empty section headers removed/retitled across `test_new_core.py`, `test_isa_ask.py`,
`test_universals.py`, `test_machine_rules.py`; blank-line runs (up to 21 consecutive in one spot)
collapsed to a max of 2. No test count change (mechanical cleanup only).

### Phase 6.0 — retire `rewriter.py`; the ISA engine is now the ONLY engine anywhere in the repo (331 passed, 1 skipped)
Deleted `ugm/cnl/rewriter.py` (807 lines) and every reference to it, migrating ~15 dependent test files
onto `run_bank`/`run_rules` or direct ISA-opcode assertions. Unblocked by the 2026-07-10 no-equivalence
ratification.

**A real scope correction found BEFORE touching code (tracing actual readers, not trusting the code's
own comments):** the three `TEMPORARY BRIDGE` dual-write sites (`attrgraph.add_relation`,
`lowering.to_attrgraph`, `lowering.lower_rhs`) all claim "drop once `rewriter.py` retires" — that's
wrong. `machine.py`'s own `MINT` intern/dedup logic reads `attrs[NAME]`/`g.name(rel)` directly (nothing
to do with the oracle), and dozens of production sites (`apply.py`, `walker.py`, `choose.py`, ...) read
a relation's predicate back via `g.name(rel)` — the primary way the ISA engine itself reads predicates
today. Removing the bridge now would break MINT dedup and predicate reads throughout the LIVE engine,
not just retire oracle support. So **the bridge stays** — it's entangled with Phase 2.3 ("name demoted
to ordinary VALUED attr, KB-declared discriminating-key indexes"), which is real, undesigned work (a
new indexing-declaration concept), not the mechanical sweep the plan doc assumed. Rescoped 2.3 out of
6.0 and back to its own phase, gated on an Opus design call. `implementation_plan.md` updated to record
this correction inline so it isn't rediscovered.

**What 6.0 actually did:**
- `ugm/cnl/authoring.py`: removed `from .rewriter import run`; `run_rules` lost its `isa`/`seeds`
  params (both dead — `run_bank` has neither an oracle branch nor a `seeds` frontier), now always
  drives `run_bank` per stratum.
- `ugm/__init__.py`: dropped the `rewriter` re-export block, `__all__` entries, and module alias.
- `ugm/decide.py`/`ugm/retraction.py`: dropped the now-nonexistent `isa=True` kwarg from `run_rules`
  callers.
- `ugm/production_rule.py`: relocated `near_rules`/a new `_anchor_names` helper here (engine-neutral,
  reads only `Rule.lhs` anchors) so walker "near-rules" introspection survives independent of any one
  matching engine.
- **Real pre-existing bug fixed in `ugm/lowering.py`**: `run_bank` ignored `Rule.meta` entirely — every
  firing minted provenance under `provenance=True` regardless of the flag, unlike the oracle's
  `emit_prov = provenance and not rule.meta` regress guard (a meta/TMS rule naming `proves`/`uses`
  would otherwise re-match the `<j:>` it just minted). No production caller was exposed (they all
  sidestep it with `provenance=False`), but `test_meta_provenance.py` exercised the documented
  "meta + ordinary rules share one run" guarantee directly — fixed rather than weakening the test.
- **Test migrations, by shape:**
  - `test_rewire.py` — rewrote all 5 tests off `rewriter.match`/`rewriter.run` onto `run_rules`/direct
    `Machine.apply` calls. Two tests (bare `cut`, and `RESTORE`-as-resurrect) have no rule-level ISA
    lowering (`lower_rewire` only recognizes the one sanctioned 3-op interposition shape by design), so
    those now exercise `INTERPOSE`/`RESTORE` directly on the `Machine`, matching how
    `test_isa_interpose.py`'s opcode-identity test already does it.
  - `test_isa_interpose.py` — its one rewriter-vs-run_bank differential test rebuilt its fixture via
    `run_rules` and now asserts the ISA engine's own before/after retraction behavior directly.
  - `test_isa_goal_graded.py`, `test_isa_lowering.py`, `test_isa_runbank.py`, `test_isa_reasoning_parity.py`
    — differential-vs-rewriter assertions converted to direct ISA-pinned expected values (computed by
    hand from the rule bank, not re-derived from a second engine), per the no-equivalence ratification.
  - `test_coref_walk.py`, `test_walkers.py` — discovered `run_rules`'s per-stratum-fixpoint stratification
    changes firing order/outcome relative to calling `run_bank` directly on the whole rule list — and
    production's `resolve_coref`/`walk_on_demand` already call `run_bank` directly, never `run_rules`.
    Fixed both test files to match production's real call shape (this also fixed a
    stratification-triggered wrong-answer in one fixture, not just a style choice).
  - `test_new_core.py`, `test_walkers.py`, `test_asp_calc.py`, `test_code_frames.py` — reimplemented
    `rewriter._relation_exists` as a local `_relation_exists` helper (plain `AttrGraph` inspection, no
    matcher), and swapped bare `h.run(...)` calls to `h.run_rules(...)`.
  - Journal-count assertions (`len(h.run(...))`) converted to before/after edge-set diffs, since
    `run_rules`/`run_bank` return no per-firing journal (an int firing count only) — that was already
    true for every production caller, just not for these oracle-era tests.
- **Tests deleted, not migrated** (no ISA equivalent exists, confirmed before deleting rather than
  assumed): `test_narrate_and_explain` (`narrate()` renders a `Firing` journal `run_rules` never
  populates; its `explain()` half duplicated an existing pinned test); `test_rule_anchors_and_wildcards`,
  `test_optimized_engine_matches_naive_engine_identical_results`,
  `test_activation_skips_irrelevant_rules_on_a_change` (tested the retired `Rewriter` class's own
  internal anchor-delta/semi-naive optimization toggles — an implementation detail of that one engine,
  no ISA analog since `run_bank` isn't a dual-mode engine). One assertion narrowed rather than deleted:
  `test_graded_firing_alpha_cut` (renamed from `..._confidence_and_alpha_cut`) — the oracle stamped a
  computed `confidence` value on created nodes that `run_bank`/`lowering.py` never implemented (GRADE
  is an α-cut filter only); the α-cut gate/fire behavior stays pinned, the confidence-VALUE assertion
  (`0.72`) is dropped as testing a feature that was never ported (out of scope for 6.0 to add).
- Bench scripts (`bench/coverage_audit.py`, `bench/wordnet_messy.py`, `bench/wordnet_scaling.py`) fixed
  too, though not required by the file-deletion gate — they lose the oracle's `seeds=` semi-naive
  frontier param (`run_bank` always matches from scratch), a real but out-of-scope (Phase 7) perf
  regression for these specific benchmarks, honestly noted inline.

`grep -rn "rewriter" ugm/ tests/` now matches only historical prose/docstrings, zero imports.
Result: **331 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** (down from 337/1/0 — every one of the 6 fewer accounted
for above: 4 deleted oracle-internals tests + 1 merged meta-provenance variant + 1 redundant
post-de-differentiation duplicate in `test_isa_runbank.py`).

## 2026-07-10

### Phase 5.5 (slices 1–3b) — firmware MODES as §8 `<call>` calculators, driven by RULES in the loop
`harneskills/mode_calls.py` — the enabling primitive for KB procedures "run as control-token programs"
(522→535 green, `tests/test_isa_mode_calls.py`).

**Slice 3b — no new surface + key-aware INTERN fix (ratified: reuse the existing `<call>` machine-rule
grammar; fix INTERN now; SUPPOSE deferred).** Mode-composing rules are authored with the EXISTING
`<call>? SLOT VALUE and … when …` grammar (`planning_requests.cnl`-style) — zero new forms, zero SLM
debt. **Key-aware INTERN fix** (`machine.py`, retires `finding-interning-aliases-predicate-literals`):
MINT-intern no longer takes `nodes_named(nm)[0]`; it skips a reified DOMAIN-RELATION candidate (graded
key == its own name, name not a reserved `<…>` token — control tokens keep interning). So a value-literal
`is`/`eats` canonicalizes to a distinct value node, never the predicate rel node. This makes RELATIONAL
mode-calls (`<call> -[pred]-> eats`) sound and retires the copula-only 3a limitation; `check_tool`'s
copula default is now mere ergonomics. Full suite green incl. reasoning parity (a core mechanism — gated
hard). Test: a CNL-authored rule emits a relational `eats` check, serviced over the backward bank, whose
derived fact drives a downstream rule.

**Slice 3a — rules emit mode-calls; the EXISTING loop services them; the effect FEEDS BACK (no new
driver, no authored surface, zero SLM debt).** Ratified framing (user): the primitive is
rules-emit-mode-calls (loop-inversion / machine-rule-CNL faithful), NOT a Python procedure DSL — the
`to NAME` linear header is later sugar. `run_bank(..., tools=mode_registry(rule_g))` ALREADY services
`<call>`s at fixpoint (`lowering.py:531`), so integration = pass the mode registry as `tools`. The CHECK
verdict is now ALSO emitted as CONTROL relations (`<check> -[status]-> S`, `-[of]-> subj`) so a forward
RULE can MATCH it and react — the plan→act→check feedback. 3 integration tests: a rule emits a CHECK
call whose POSITIVE materialization drives a downstream rule; a rule REACTS to a CWA `assumed-no` verdict
(nothing materialized — the verdict relations carry it); a rule emits a CHOOSE call whose winner drives a
downstream rule. The forward bank does NOT contain the reasoning that answers the goal — only the
serviced mode-call produces it, proving the composition is real.

**SHARP EDGE found + tracked (`finding-interning-aliases-predicate-literals`):** a rule that materializes
a `<call>` carrying the goal PREDICATE as an object literal (`<call> -[pred]-> is`) runs away + corrupts,
because `MINT(intern=True)` interns the literal `"is"` to the EXISTING `is` **predicate** rel node (same
name) — wiring the `<call>` into the fact graph so it re-matches `?x is bird` forever. Root cause:
interning is by NAME, conflating a value-literal with a same-named predicate (the Phase-2 name/key split
not yet enforced at INTERN). Interim 3a fix: `check_tool` defaulted `pred` to the copula. **RESOLVED in
3b (above) by the key-aware INTERN fix** — relational predicates now carry safely; the copula default is
now mere ergonomics.

**Slices 1–2 — the primitive.** A reasoning MODE is invoked exactly like a tool: a
rule/procedure materializes a `<call> --tool--> check` node with goal slots (`pred`/`subj`/`obj`); the
dumb dispatcher (`dispatch.service_calls`) runs the firmware `check` and folds a `<check>` verdict node
(a CONTROL token carrying the goal + one of the 4 CHECK statuses as VALUED attrs) back, consuming the
call. This is `decision-agentic-direction`'s "tools as calculators" applied to the modes themselves —
WHICH mode fires and WHEN is decided by the calls present (DATA), never the content-blind dispatcher.
Reuses the existing `<call>` loop (`decision-materialized-tool-calls`), NOT a new driver ("the loop
already exists — reuse, don't rebuild"). Lives at `harneskills/` level (a bridge like `procedure.py`;
inside `isa/` it closes an import cycle through `world_model`).
- **Slice 1 — CHECK** (goal → `<check>` verdict). 6 tests reproduce all 4 statuses vs. the direct
  `check(...)` call, pin the verdict as control (invisible to fact matching), show several calls each
  serviced + consumed.
- **Slice 2 — CHOOSE** (`<call> --tool--> choose --goal--> G [--alpha--> a]`): runs the firmware
  `choose` over the goal's pre-registered candidates (α-cut + argmax), marks `satisfied_by`/`beaten`;
  `choice_results` reads winners back. CHOOSE needs no rule bank. 3 tests: argmax winner, α-cut prunes
  all, and a HETEROGENEOUS program (a CHECK call + a CHOOSE call in one graph, both serviced). SUPPOSE
  is deliberately NOT a single call — its assumptions/predictions are variable-length lists, a scope the
  CNL surface lays down (slice 3), so forcing it into fixed slots would be a workaround.

Remaining 5.5 slices: **3b** — the CNL procedure surface that EMITS mode-calls (+ a non-aliasing
predicate encoding for relational checks, + SUPPOSE scope authoring; SLM debt); then **slice 4** —
plan→act→check→replan as ITERATE×CHECK; then the Phase-5 exit gate.

### Phase 5.4 — DECLARED strategies replace shape-sniffing (delete the three sniffers)
The engine no longer reverse-engineers a strategy from rule shape/naming; it reads a DECLARATION
(`feedback-no-hardcoded-engine-policy`). Two sniffer families in `goal.py` deleted (519→522 green:
+2 walker-declaration tests, +1 coref-tag pin; no pre-existing answer changed).

**5.4a — walker/transitive (test-only in production, answers-identical → low risk).** Deleted
`_is_transitive_closure_rule`, `_linear_recursion_base`, `_closure_bases` (the ~90-line rule-shape
matchers). Replaced by `_closure_declarations(ag)`, which reads the walker base map from the
SUBSTRATE: `R is transitive` → the CANONICAL `R -[rel_property]-> transitive` fact (the SAME
declaration `rule_graph.expand_relation_properties` already uses to GENERATE the transitivity rule —
it now does double duty), and `D -[transitive_closure_of]-> B` for linear recursion over a different
base. `GoalSolver` gains a `closures=` param (defaults to reading `self.ag`); nested solvers are
handed the parent's map. Note: `walk_fuel` is NEVER set in production (every production `GoalSolver`
is fuel-less), so the walker + these sniffers were test-only — deleting them is a pure de-sniffing
with zero production behavior change. Walker tests now DECLARE the strategy in their graphs; a new
end-to-end test drives the full CNL `is_a is transitive` → `rel_property` fact → `_closure_declarations`
→ walker chain.

**5.4b — coref-follow (production-semantic → behavior-preserving + differentially gated).** Deleted
`_is_same_as_prop` (which sniffed `r.key.startswith("same_as.subj.")`). `Rule` gains a declared
`coref_prop: bool` role (like `meta`); `universal.same_as_rules` sets it `True`; `GoalSolver.__init__`
reads `r.coref_prop` (not the key) to turn coref-following ON and drop the propagation rules as
subsumed by its union-find. This repairs a LOSSY path: `same_as_rules(preds)` already declared the
coref role, the result was discarded, and `_is_same_as_prop` re-derived it by matching the keys
`same_as_rules` itself minted. The tag carries the declaration forward instead of re-sniffing it —
the same category as the existing `nac`/`propagate`/`meta` rule-data the engine reads. Full suite
answer-identical (every pre-existing test unchanged). Pinned: `test_coref_following_is_driven_by_the_declared_flag_not_the_rule_key`
(a rule with the same key/shape but `coref_prop=False` is NOT treated as a propagation rule — the FLAG decides).

**TRACKED RESIDUAL VIOLATION (ratified with the user 2026-07-10 — chose option A, "tag now"; log it,
don't paper over it).** 5.4b closes the ENGINE-sniffing violation (A) but NOT the deeper
`no-python-for-banks` violation (B): WHICH predicates propagate coref is still chosen in Python
(`session.py`'s `CONTENT_PREDS` constant), and the propagation RULES are still Python-generated by
`same_as_rules`. The vision-faithful end-state — a bank-authored `same_as propagates through X` CNL
surface that both generates the rules AND signals following — is NOT reachable now because it needs
the coref rules REIFIED/authored (the Phase-3 homoiconicity quote/eval wall, explicitly parked). So
the CNL surface is deferred to **Phase 3**, where it can be done whole rather than bolted onto
still-Python machinery with migration + SLM-surface risk. The `coref_prop` tag is forward-compatible:
when rules reify it becomes a graph attribute on the rule node, same read site. See `implementation_plan.md`
Phase 3 (tracked) and Phase 5.4.

### Phase 5.3 — SUPPOSE firmware: `<hypothesis>` scopes as the pencil/ink split (same-graph, not branching)
`harneskills/isa/suppose.py` — firmware v2 mode 6 ("what if" — entertain before believing). The
hypothesis-formulation-and-verification mechanism (`processing_modes.md` §3), composed from CHAIN + CHECK
inside a scoped control region. NOT possible-worlds: reasoning happens on the SAME graph, segregated by a
scope tag — never a `graph.copy()` branch (the trap mode 6 names).

The non-additive part, exactly as the plan's design crux predicted: CHECK/CHOOSE were pure additions over
`chain_sip`; SUPPOSE could not be, because the pencil (assumed facts) are CONTROL nodes and matching
deliberately IGNORES control. So **scope-aware matching** landed as a `scope=` param on
`apply._fact_relnodes` / `chain._facts_matching` / `_fact_exists`/`_find_fact_relnode`, **gated
behavior-NEUTRAL at `scope=None`** (the default everywhere but in-scope reasoning) — differentially proven
against the pre-existing firmware gates (511→519, all 34 gate tests + full suite green). A pencil fact is a
CONTROL rel node tagged `apply.SCOPE = "scope"` (a VALUED attr naming the `<hypothesis>` id): invisible to
ordinary matching (never touches ink), visible ONLY within its scope. `chain_sip(scope=…)` sees pencil+ink
and EMITs its derivations back in pencil.

`suppose(fact_g, rule_g, assumptions, predictions)` → `SupposeResult(status, committed, contradiction,
looked_for)`: mint a `<hypothesis>` scope, pencil the assumptions, CHAIN each prediction and its `_neg_pred`
in-scope, then **REFUTED** iff a prediction's negation is entailed in-scope (the supposition entails the
opposite) → `_drop_scope` (sweep every scope-tagged control rel + the hypothesis; ink untouched); **CONFIRMED**
iff every prediction holds and none contradicted → EMIT the assumptions to INK (optional `<j:confirmed>`
provenance), then sweep the pencil; **INCONCLUSIVE** (no contradiction, not all predictions derivable in
budget) → drop, ink untouched. The fact layer stays MONOTONE throughout — no retraction, because nothing
unconfirmed became a fact (the pencil/ink split doing its designed job). `explain_suppose` renders the verdict
+ what entered ink + what the in-scope reasoning explored. v0: assumption endpoints are real (only the RELATION
is pencil); CONFIRM commits only the assumptions (consequences re-derive from ink forward). Caveat logged:
`lowering.derived_triples` includes control rel nodes, so an ink-only reader must skip control/inert (see
`tests/test_isa_suppose._ink`). Tests: `tests/test_isa_suppose.py` (8) — behavior-neutral invisibility,
in-scope pencil derivation, confirm→ink-survives-teardown, refute/inconclusive→ink-untouched, two-supposes-
same-graph independence, explain. 519 green.

### Phase 5.2 — CHOOSE firmware: graded α-cut argmax over candidate frames (monotone, losers retained)
`harneskills/isa/choose.py` — firmware v2 mode 5 ("comparing options and picking"). Realizes the LOCKED
means-selection design (`graded_means_selection_design.md`, mechanism 1b "RETAINED/RANKED, MONOTONE — no
retraction"), which had been designed but NEVER built (no `select.cnl`, no `beaten`/`satisfied_by` anywhere).
`choose(g, goal, alpha=…)`: candidates are option nodes reachable by a `candidate` relation, each carrying a
graded `fit` (a VALUED float in [0,1] — invisible to the embedding view; however produced — authored
`has_fit` or a graded rule condition's α-cut degree). α-cut prunes below `alpha`, then the winner is the
argmax = the candidate NOTHING BEATS (a candidate is `beaten` iff an eligible one has STRICTLY greater fit —
the design's `satisfied_by ... and not ... beaten`, computed by the firmware driver, no `<compare>` tool
needed since fit is a real float). MONOTONE: winners marked `goal -[satisfied_by]-> w`, eligible losers
marked `beaten` and RETAINED (auditable why-trace); nothing retracted (§5). TIES (equal max) → all tied win.
α-cut and selection COMPOSE as two filters — an α-pruned candidate is INELIGIBLE, not `beaten` (it never
entered the comparison). `explain_choice` renders the winner + beaten alternatives with fits. TESTED
(`tests/test_isa_choose.py`) on the design's exact fixtures (complex_page 0.8 beats simple_page 0.3; equal-fit
tie offers both; single candidate trivially satisfied; α-cut prunes before selection) + a 200-seed randomized
differential vs an independent argmax reference (winners == eligible-max set for random fits × random α).
v0 scope: fit is an INPUT — computing it from a rule's graded condition DURING matching (the α-cut in the
APPLY/CHAIN body, `_graded_degree`) is the companion slice; the planner's `chosen` operator pick as a declared
CHOOSE is the follow-on. Next: Phase 5.3 SUPPOSE (`<hypothesis>` scopes).

### Phase 5.1 — CHECK firmware: bounded completion -> a 4-status CWA-default verdict + "where I looked"
`harneskills/isa/check.py` — firmware v2's first mode (`processing_modes.md` mode 4, "looking for something
and possibly not finding it"). `check(fact_g, rule_g, goal, open_preds=…)` runs CHAIN (`chain_sip`, the
bounded demand-driven prover) and reads the outcome as ONE of four statuses (`decision-cwa-default`'s model):
POSITIVE (derivable), ENTAILED_NEG (the negative `pred_not` is derivable — a HARD no, e.g. from disjointness),
ASSUMED_NO (neither derivable + closed-world default — a DEFEASIBLE no, computed from the demand closure, §5-
safe: nothing materialized/retracted for it), UNKNOWN (neither derivable + the concept is OPEN, `open_preds` —
gather instead of assume). `collapse()` maps the four to the yes/no/unknown a caller acts on — exactly
`query.ask_goal`'s verdict, which `GoalSolver` computes but COLLAPSES the two negative KINDs; CHECK keeps the
KIND distinct (the signal the metareasoning/escalation layer needs). `explain_check()` renders the verdict
plus "where I looked" from the visible `<demand>` magic set (`render_demands`) — what makes an assumed-no
honest and renderable ("I looked for X and Y within budget and found nothing"), not a claim about the universe.
DIFFERENTIALLY GATED (`tests/test_isa_check.py`): over 12 random positive banks × every bound goal (500+
checks) with a mix of closed and open concepts, `collapse(check(...))` EQUALS the `GoalSolver`-based
`ask_goal` verdict (yes/assumed-no/unknown) exactly; the four statuses and the "where I looked" trace are
pinned individually (incl. an ENTAILED_NEG from a `penguin -> is_not flyer` rule). v1 scope: negative
predicate is `pred + "_not"` (the `decide.NEG_COPULA` convention generalized); ENTAILED_NEG fires only where
the bank has negative-producing rules. NOTE: the reasoning-side AGGRESSIVE `is_not` completion (materialize
the negative for closed-world predicates — `decide.solve`'s elimination) is a distinct write-side mechanism,
not this query verdict; it composes in with CHOOSE/elimination. Next: Phase 5.2 CHOOSE (graded α-cut).

### Phase 4.4 — the firmware TRACE RENDERER (the phase gate): RECORD + journal-replay + firmware==GoalSolver
The firmware now JOURNALS natively (`processing_modes.md` mode 9, "not optional") and its derivations RENDER
as CNL, and it is proven equal to the reference backward engine on the positive slice — the three things
Phase 4.4 owes:
- **RECORD (mode 9), `harneskills/isa/apply.py` `_record`.** APPLY (`_apply_pass`/`apply_to_fixpoint`) and
  CHAIN (`chain_sip`) mint a `<j:rulekey>` justification per firing — `proves -> head`, `uses -> each body
  fact node` — in the SAME inert substrate shape `GoalSolver._justify` / `rewriter` write. Opt-in
  `provenance=True` (default OFF, so the derivation-set differential gates stay clean; provenance nodes are
  INERT — invisible to matching/`relations_from`). `uses` is recorded in AUTHORED rule order so the journal
  is byte-identical to `run_bank`'s.
- **RENDER = journal replay.** Because the journal is the standard `proves`/`uses` support and
  `world_model.Graph = AttrGraph`, a firmware derivation explains through the EXISTING `surface.explain`
  with NO firmware-specific renderer — "explanation = RECORD, replayed" (vision §9). Pinned: a `chain_sip`
  derivation renders as a proof tree (`socrates is_a mortal <- mortal` / `... <- person` / `... (given)`),
  and an APPLY derivation explains BYTE-IDENTICALLY to `run_bank(provenance=True)`.
- **`render_demands`** — the bound magic set (visible `<demand>` nodes) rendered as CNL "what I looked for"
  lines, scoped to the goal subject by SIP (the demand half of the trace; CHECK's "where I looked" negative
  trace extends it in Phase 5).
- **EXIT GATE — firmware == GoalSolver on the ProofWriter positive slice** (`tests/test_isa_firmware_gate.py`).
  A randomized differential over a representative positive-Horn pool (is_a transitivity + a two-relation
  inheritance join + a linear implication + a conjunctive-body rule) across 20 random fact graphs and every
  binding pattern of a goal (1000+ checks): `chain_sip`'s goal answers EQUAL `GoalSolver.solve`'s everywhere.
  The two demand-driven engines — one hidden-dict tabling, one visible-`<demand>` firmware — agree exactly.
`tests/test_isa_trace.py` + `tests/test_isa_firmware_gate.py`. NOTE: live rendering of the EPHEMERAL
`<frame>`/`<current-atom>` working state (a debug affordance) and the not-yet-built modes' traces (CHECK
"where I looked", SUPPOSE scopes) are deferred with their Phase-5 modes; the persistent journal IS the
explanation for the positive core. **Phase 4 (the firmware POSITIVE CORE) is complete through its gate.**

### Phase 4.1 — CHAIN bound-tuple SIP: `<demand>` promoted from predicate grain to tuple grain (493 tests)
`harneskills/isa/chain.py` — `chain_sip(fact_g, rule_g, (pred, subj|None, obj|None))` answers a BOUND-TUPLE
goal demand-driven, the magic set GoalSolver computes at tuple grain (`goal.py`'s `_join_body`/`_pat_goal`)
realized as VISIBLE bound `<demand>` nodes over the reified rules. A demand is a bound tuple carried on a
`<demand>` control node (`for=/subj=/obj=`); evaluation INTERLEAVES demand-raising with per-env body
evaluation (a body atom's sub-demand is raised under the env bound so far, so a join var bound by an earlier
atom grounds the next atom's demand) and iterates to a fixpoint. The win over v0's predicate-grain `chain`:
it prunes by SUBJECT/OBJECT, not just predicate — a goal `is_a(socrates, ?)` never demands a second
philosopher `plato`'s facts (differentially pinned: `run_bank`'s full closure HAS `plato is_a mortal`,
`chain_sip` does not, while being COMPLETE for the socrates tuples; a two-chain transitive goal likewise
skips the off-goal chain). REAL BUG caught in design + differential test: seeding the body by df selectivity
(APPLY's heuristic) is UNSOUND for SIP — it can front-load an atom whose join var isn't bound yet, raising an
UNBOUND `(pred, None, None)` sub-demand that floods in every off-goal tuple (`zeb is_a delta` leaked). Fixed
with `_sideways_order`: process an atom only once it has a pruning endpoint (a literal, or a var bound by the
head-unify / an earlier atom) — binding order, not selectivity, keeps the magic set scoped; a disconnected
remainder falls back to a full scan (correct, unpruned). v1 scope: positive rules, plain-literal predicates,
unique-noded names; the per-env bindings stay a Python env (the headline visible gadget is the bound
`<demand>`; promoting the env to a `<frame>` as APPLY does is a later unification). v0 `chain` (predicate
grain) + its tests are retained. **Phase 4.1 is now COMPLETE** (APPLY cursor + `<fresh>` delta last session,
CHAIN bound-tuple SIP this one). Next: Phase 4.4 the trace renderer (the phase gate). See plan Phase 4.1.

### Phase 4.1 — firmware gadgets: `<current-atom>` cursor + `<fresh>` semi-naive delta (490 tests)
The last two pieces of hidden APPLY driver state become VISIBLE graph structure (`harneskills/isa/apply.py`),
each behavior-neutral / differentially gated vs `run_bank`:
- **`<current-atom>` cursor over a `next`-chain itinerary.** The body-atom loop is no longer a Python loop
  index: `_build_itinerary` materializes the df-sorted body as a visible chain of `<atom>` step nodes (each
  carrying its `(subj, pred, obj)` tokens as VALUED attrs), linked by a control `next` relation, with a
  `<current-atom>` cursor pointing `at` the head. `_apply_pass` reads the atom to match FROM the cursor and
  ADVANCES it along `next` — so "which body atom is current" AND the whole df-sorted sequence (the driver's
  one heuristic choice) are graph a trace renderer can read. The itinerary lives on FRESH control nodes only
  — it never touches the reified rule's patoms (an edge into a patom would corrupt `_read_atoms`) — and is
  GC'd with the frames. Pinned: `test_body_atom_cursor_is_a_visible_itinerary_that_advances`.
- **`<fresh>` semi-naive delta for the SATURATE fixpoint.** `apply_to_fixpoint` no longer re-joins the whole
  body every round: it full-joins once (the seed), then each round re-derives only from the previous round's
  DELTA — for each body position in turn, that atom draws from `fresh` while the others stay full
  (delta-substitution, mirroring `GoalSolver._delta_join`). The delta atom is marked `<fresh>` on the
  itinerary (the semi-naive position as visible structure, not a hidden flag). CORRECTNESS SUBTLETY caught in
  design: `_apply_pass` re-sorts the body by df each call, so the fixpoint FREEZES one df order per round and
  passes it to every position's pass — else `delta_pos` could name different atoms across a round and an atom
  might never take its delta turn (a silent incompleteness). Differentially identical to the naive fixpoint
  (`test_apply_transitivity_recursion_matches_run_bank` + a longer multi-round chain); the count and the
  derived-triple set both match `run_bank`. Pinned: `test_fresh_delta_atom_is_marked_visible_on_the_itinerary`,
  `test_semi_naive_fixpoint_derives_the_full_transitive_closure_over_many_rounds`. `apply_rule` refactored to
  a thin `len(_apply_pass(...))` full-pass wrapper (signature/behavior unchanged; CHAIN + tests untouched).
Phase 4.1 REMAINING: the bound-tuple SIP for CHAIN (promote the predicate-grain `<demand>` to per-bound-tuple
magic sets, mining `goal.py`'s SIP) — a larger, separate slice. Then Phase 4.4 the trace renderer (the gate).
See `docs/implementation_plan.md` Phase 4.1.

### Phase 3.3 + 4.3 — head index as graph structure + CHAIN firmware v0 (487 tests)
Head index (`apply.build_head_index`/`rules_producing`): a `<head-index>` hub with `hub -[headPred]-> rule`
per rule head predicate — the catalog-key→rule map as SUBSTRATE structure (queried via `relations_from`, no
Python dict), built to CHAIN's query shape. CHAIN v0 (`harneskills/isa/chain.py`): `chain(fact_g, rule_g,
goal_pred)` closes the demand set BACKWARD from the goal predicate through the head index (a demanded pred
pulls in the body predicates of every rule producing it, transitively), minting a VISIBLE `<demand>` control
node per predicate (the magic set, inspectable), then APPLYs only the relevant rules to quiescence.
DIFFERENTIALLY GATED vs `run_bank` over the full bank: CHAIN derives exactly the goal-predicate facts the
full closure does (complete for the goal) while NEVER applying an irrelevant rule — pinned by a bank where
the `likes` rule is provably skipped for an `is_a` goal, and a transitive goal reproduces `run_bank` exactly.
v0 scope: predicate-grain demand (restricts which rules run, not yet which tuples — bound-arg SIP is v1);
positive rules. See `docs/implementation_plan.md` Phase 4.3.

### Phase 4.2 — APPLY firmware v0: reified-rule match with a VISIBLE frame (482 tests)
`harneskills/isa/apply.py` — the first slice of the universal firmware, and the proof of its thesis on
the positive core. `apply_rule`/`apply_to_fixpoint` match a REIFIED rule (Phase 3.1's in-graph shape, read
straight from the rule node — "APPLY over reified rules") against the facts and EMIT the head, with the
binding environment held as VISIBLE graph structure: a partial match is a `<frame>` control node, each
binding a reified relation `<frame> -[?var]-> node` (GoalSolver's hidden bindings dict, now inspectable —
the 4.1 win). df seed-from-rarest (the only heuristic); EMIT monotone with CHECK-BEFORE-DERIVE (an existing
head fact is the memo → a recursive rule terminates under the SATURATE fixpoint wrapper); fuel-bounded.
DIFFERENTIALLY GATED against `run_bank` on single-atom, 3-way join, transitive recursion, and near-miss —
APPLY over the reified form derives exactly what `run_bank` derives over the Python `Rule`. The differential
gate caught a real bug: an in-graph frame binding adds an incoming edge to the bound fact node, making an
entity look like a rel node to `derived_triples` — fixed by GC'ing the ephemeral frames (nodes + binding
edges) after each pass (a preview of the one-graph-fold hazard). v0 scope: positive rules, literal
predicates, no fresh-RHS MINT; Python driver with visible bindings. See `docs/implementation_plan.md`
Phase 4.2.

### Phase 3.1 step 1 — canonical reified rule shape, 2.1/2.2-aligned (478 tests)
`rule_graph.write_rule` modernized so a reified rule is literally in the shape of the facts it rewrites.
(a) Every rule-structure node — rule node, shared var/literal nodes, per-Pat predicate nodes, role
relations — is now `control`-flagged, so a folded ONE-graph can segregate pattern-space from fact-space by
the control flag (the `goal.py` control-rel skip) instead of the current separate rule-graph — the
meta-circular one-graph milestone, unblocked by 2.2. (b) Each pattern atom is built in FACT SHAPE via
`add_relation` (predicate carried as a graded KEY `{is_a: 1.0}`, not a bare name), so the firmware's APPLY
can seed a pattern predicate through `nodes_with_key`/`has_key` exactly as it seeds a fact. Round-trip
(`rules_in_graph`) unchanged and exact (name-based read still works via the dual-write bridge);
differentially clean. SCOPING (with the user): Phase 3 is the prerequisite for Phase 4's firmware, which
needs the reified rule SHAPE not the "built by FORM rules" authoring — so the meta-circular FORM-rule
quote/eval wall is deferred as a purity milestone off Phase 4's path. Pinned:
`test_reified_rule_is_control_layer_and_pattern_predicates_are_keyed`. See `docs/implementation_plan.md`
Phase 3.

### Phase 2.2 — control TOKENS as keys, half 1: the name→key dual-write (475 tests)
A reserved control token (`<…>` syntax) minted as a NODE (`AttrGraph.add_node("<goal>")`) now ALSO
carries its token as a graded key `{<goal>: 1.0}` — the same dual-write `add_relation` already does for
control PREDICATES — so `nodes_with_key`/`has_key` can eventually replace the name-based
`nodes_named("<token>")` reads (the Phase-6 reader flip). Reserved to `<…>` names (an ordinary entity
like `Paul` gets no graded key). `AttrNode.embedding` filters `<…>` keys back out (like an inert node
reports none), keeping the fuzzy/similarity/`propagate` view token-free. T-norm is unaffected — a token
key is always degree 1.0 (identity for T_MIN/T_PROD), and degrees compose into `score` only via explicit
GRADE/FUZZY α-cut ops that crisp token matching never invokes — so the regular graded namespace is safe
(the `<…>` syntax gives the view-level distinction for free; no reserved namespace). ADDITIVE: the legacy
VALUED name stays (oracle bridge), no current reader changes; differentially clean. Repr ratified with the
user: graded key in the regular namespace + embedding `<…>` filter.

### Phase 2.2 — control TOKENS as keys, half 2: control-ness at the mint chokepoint (475 tests)
`AttrGraph.add_node` now applies the ratified control-ness criterion — reserved `<…>` syntax + NOT inert
⟹ `control=True` — so every control token is flag-queryable (`is_control`) for the Phase-6 reader flip;
inert provenance (`<j:…>`/`<axiom>`) is excluded (inert, not control); a caller's explicit `control=` only
promotes. The flag is READ in production (goal.py control-rel skip, DROP_CTRL, `_fingerprint`'s control-edge
exclusion), so this was run as a HYPOTHESIS gated by the full differential suite, not assumed additive.
RESULT: behavior-neutral across all 475 tests except one RATIFIED divergence —
`test_isa_drop.py::test_drop_of_a_fact_is_refused`: a bare edge-less `<go>` token is now control, so
`run_bank`'s orphan-control GC sweeps it (correct — orphan control scaffolding is ephemeral; real control
tokens always carry edges); the test re-establishes the token before use. So the anticipated
"family-by-family" caution proved empirically unnecessary — one content-blind rule at the chokepoint is safe.
2.2's only remaining item is the Phase-6 reader flip (`nodes_named`→`nodes_with_key`, node `startswith("<")`
→`is_control`), now SAFE but deferred with the dual-write name drop until the oracle retires. See
`docs/implementation_plan.md` Phase 2.2.

### Phase 1 exit cleanup — two pinning tests resolved (469 tests)
The prior session's two PRE-EXISTING failures were confirmed RATIFIED Phase 2.1/2.2 migration
outcomes (not regressions) and updated to lock in the new behavior:
`test_skip_inert_excludes_provenance_from_matching` builds its `uses` node with `inert=True`
(flag-first design — `Machine._inert` reads the `.inert` flag, superseding the name sniff);
`test_finding_reserved_predicate_silently_dropped_from_body` flips `not in`→`in` (the `?u uses ?r`
body clause is no longer silently dropped — name-based predicate reservation went away with the
predicate-key migration). Full suite green: 469 passed.

### Phase 2.2 — `_is_inert` name-sniff → `.inert` flag: NODE-INSTANCE migration complete (469 tests)
Every node-instance provenance-skip now reads the `.inert` FLAG instead of sniffing the node's name.
Flipped: the WORLD_MODEL subject-finder family — the 8 identical
`next((n for n in g.into(r) if not _is_inert(g.name(n))), None)` readers across
`authoring`/`deontic`/`forms`×3/`planning_kb`/`session`×2 — plus `decide.py`'s closed-world-predicate
collector and `universal.py`'s `entailed_negation_rules` node-loop; dead `_is_inert` imports dropped
from all 7 files. Precondition first: the last two UNFLAGGED provenance mint sites
(`provenance.ensure_axiom`'s `<axiom>` node, `axiomatize`'s `<axiom>--proves-->rel`) now pass
`inert=True`, so every `<j:>`/`<axiom>`/`proves`/`uses` node an `into(r)` subject-scan can encounter
carries the flag. Differentially clean against the still-name-based `rewriter` oracle.
The remaining `_is_inert` calls STAY name-based BY DESIGN (not deferred flips): pattern/literal-side
guards over rule/goal tokens (`goal.py:727/743`, `lowering.py:400/573`, `rewriter.py:78` — a literal
is a string, not a node); the `rewriter` oracle itself (`rewriter.py:59`, reads uniformly by name);
and the `to_attrgraph` bridge (`lowering.py:86`, Phase-6 expiry, arbitrary-input safety).
GUARD TESTS (`tests/test_meta_provenance.py`) pin the migration's precondition — `is_inert(n) ⟺
name∈{proves,uses,<j:…>,<axiom>}` after a prov-on run + `axiomatize`, on BOTH the oracle and ISA mint
paths — so a future unflagged mint fails loudly instead of silently leaking (the exponential-hang class
from the prior session); a third test pins that `<retracted>` is name-inert but NEVER `inert`-flagged
(so `_is_inert` name-fn is a strict SUPERSET of the flag; the marker hides a fact by name-mismatch, not
inert-skip). KEY FINDING for the NEXT 2.2 slice: `startswith("<")` is the ratified content-blind
RESERVED-SYNTAX criterion (`decision-control-ness-criterion`), NOT the content-list debt `_INERT_NAMES`
was — it must NOT be flipped to `is_control` (would misclassify `inert`-flagged `<axiom>` and unflagged
`<…>` tokens as entities). "Control tokens as keys" is representational work, not a reader sweep. See
`docs/implementation_plan.md` Phase 2.2.

### Phase 0.5 (cont.) — `rewriter` retired from the PRODUCTION runtime (test-only oracle) (465 tests)

Migrated the last three production modules that still called the reference `rewriter` at runtime, so the
production runtime is now **100% the ISA engine**. `rewriter.py` is RETAINED deliberately as the
differential-test ORACLE (the "two independent engines must agree" safety net — it caught this session's
fired-keying bug); its outright deletion is sequenced for Phase 6, once firmware subsumes it. (User chose
"make it test-only" over full deletion, to keep the oracle.)

- **`Firing` relocated to `production_rule.py`** (an engine-neutral home). `rewriter` re-imports it for
  back-compat (`rewriter.Firing` still resolves); `surface`/`driver` now import it from `production_rule`.
  One class, sourced once (`Firing is` identical across all modules).

- **`query.ask`'s matcher → the ISA (`lowering.match_pats`).** A new pure one-shot matcher: lowers a Pat
  conjunction with `lower_conj` and runs `Machine.match`, returning `{binding-key -> node id}` — the ISA
  face of `rewriter.match`, with the same `skip_inert = not _pats_touch_prov` default and duplicate-binding
  collapse. Differential-clean vs `rewriter.match` on existential / who / literal-subject / conjunction
  queries. `query.py` now imports `match_pats as match`; the yes-no/who/nary read paths are unchanged.

- **`driver.drive` → the ISA.** A stratified phase runs via `run_rules(isa=True)` (per-stratum `run_bank`);
  a non-stratified phase is a PLAIN fixpoint = `run_bank` directly (no stratification, as the "plain
  fixpoint runner" intends). Neither surfaces a `Firing` journal — but every `drive` caller (session at
  :281/:337) already DISCARDS the return, and `explain` reads the backward `GoalSolver` trace, so nothing is
  lost. `driver` no longer imports `rewriter`.

- **`run_rules` `isa=False` fallback retained as oracle access.** It is NOT dead — `test_isa_interpose`'s
  differential drives BOTH engines through it (`isa=isa`), and ~30 tests use `run_rules`/`h.run` as the
  reference. `authoring` keeps its `from .rewriter import run` (documented oracle-only; no production caller
  reaches the branch). The `__init__` re-exports (`h.run`/`h.match`/…) likewise stay — dozens of oracle
  tests use them.

**Result: no production runtime path calls `rewriter`.** Remaining `rewriter` references are the retained
oracle: the `run_rules` `isa=False` branch, the `__init__`/`authoring` imports that expose it, and the 23
differential test files. Deleting `rewriter.py` (Phase 6) is now purely a test-oracle-retirement decision,
not a production concern.

### Phase 0.5 (cont.) — `session:480` onto the ISA; forward `rewriter.run` off the production path (465 tests)

Moved the LAST production forward-`run` caller (`session.py:480` rule-source recognition) onto `run_bank`.
An investigation first established this was **NOT Phase 4.1** (semi-naive SEED), contrary to the standing
note (`finding-session480-not-phase41`): the whole-graph "double NAC" was a `fired`-suppression keying bug,
not a frontier problem.

- **Root cause.** The `forms` list legitimately carries DUPLICATE rule keys (default forms in
  `RULE_SOURCE_FORMS` + the per-KB generators that regenerate those same defaults — 14 dupes:
  `rule.cond.do_not`, `rule.kw.very`, `rule.plural.people`, …). `rewriter` keys `fired` by
  `(rule.key, bindings)` so duplicates SHARE suppression (fire once); `run_bank` keyed `fired`
  PER-RULE-INDEX (`fired[i]`) so each duplicate fired independently → the Skolem-minting rule-source form
  minted TWO `<cond>` NAC nodes. (Only Skolem-minting rules exposed it; a deduping fact head would hide it —
  the same class as the Phase-0.3 INTERN/DEDUP fixes.)

- **The fix (lowering.py).** `run_bank`'s `fired` is now a single `set[(rule.key, sig)]` instead of a
  per-index list — exactly `rewriter`'s cross-duplicate suppression, robust to duplicate rules in any bank.
  Differential-clean: a rule listed twice fires once on both engines with identical derived triples.

- **`session.py:480` → `run_bank(self.kb, forms)`.** Whole-graph is correct — `normalize_surface` already
  strips every PRIOR sentence's `next`/`first` chain, so the forms see only the current sentence (no seed
  frontier needed). `run_bank` returns a count (recognition firings are not surfaced in `explain`), so the
  journal is unaffected — validated: the full 465-suite passes, including `test_universals`'
  verb-negation-folds-to-a-NAC canary. The now-dead `rewriter.run` imports dropped from `session` and `walker`.

**Deleting `rewriter.py` is now a mechanical sweep** (no forward-`run` production callers remain): the
`run_rules` `isa=False` fallback (`authoring.py:995`, dead in production — only non-`isa` test callers reach
it), `rewriter.match` (query.py + tests), `Firing` (surface/driver — a plain dataclass to relocate), and
`driver.py:55`'s non-stratified `run`. Phase 4.1 (semi-naive) remains a real PERFORMANCE item, off this path.

### Phase 0.5 (cont.) — coref walk + decide (both phases) onto the ISA engine (465 tests)

Peeled the last two non-blocked `run` callers off the forward `rewriter`: the coreference cursor walk
and the `decide` completion/defeat oracle. After this, the ONLY production `run` caller left is
`session.py:480` (rule-source recognition), which is genuinely gated on the semi-naive SEED frontier
(Phase 4.1). Every `run_rules` production caller now passes `isa=True`.

- **coref_walk → `run_bank(provenance=True)`.** The blocker (diagnosed last entry) was that
  `materialize_cursor`/`settle_tool` (Python helpers) minted the cursor scaffolding — `<coref>` token,
  `coref_mention`/`coref_a`/`coref_b`/`coref_pnext`/`coref_cursor`, the `settled` barrier — as FACTS, so the
  `<coref>`-gated `ADVANCE` rule's `drop` of `coref_cursor` was `DROP_CTRL`-refused. FIX: stamp all cursor
  scaffolding `control=True` in the helpers (the same tool-minted-marker discipline as Phase 0.3's
  `done`/`ranked`) — harmless on the rewriter path (it ignores the flag), and it lets the drop lower to
  DROP_CTRL over control edges. **CLASSIFIED DIVERGENCE (ratified):** COMMIT/CLASH are `<coref>`-gated, so
  their `same_as`/`not_same_as` heads are now CONTROL-stamped (like the walker shortcut) where `rewriter`
  made them facts — defensible: a coref verdict is a retractable belief, control-layer is its home, and
  matching ignores the flag so `same_as` propagation is unaffected. `session.py:312` DEMAND_COREF migrated
  too (the demand→`<call> coref` rules; the tool runs the walk). The now-dead `rewriter.run` import dropped.

- **`decide` phase 1 → `isa=True`.** The completion/defeat/entailed-negation reasoning (the CWA oracle,
  `[*rules, DEFEAT_SEED]`, provenance ON, stratified) now runs on `run_bank` — differential-clean on
  `test_decide`/`test_riddles`/`test_cards_*`/`test_contract` (162 green in the decide-adjacent set). With
  phase 2 already migrated (prior entry), `decide` is FULLY on the ISA. The `run_rules` `isa=False` fallback
  (`authoring.py:995`) is now dead in production (every caller passes `isa=True`); it survives only for
  non-`isa` test callers until `rewriter` is deleted.

**Deleting `rewriter.py` now gated on ONE production caller:** `session.py:480` rule-source recognition,
which whole-graph `run_bank` double-fires (the Skolem NAC-pattern form needs the semi-naive `<fresh>` SEED
frontier — Phase 4.1). Also remaining: `rewriter.match` (query.py + tests), `Firing` (surface/driver),
`driver.py:55`'s non-stratified `run` — mechanical once Phase 4.1 lands.

### Phase 0.5 (cont.) — INTERPOSE opcode; TMS retraction onto the ISA engine (465 tests)

Built the **`INTERPOSE`/`RESTORE` opcodes** (isa-reference.md "Reserved: INTERPOSE / RESTORE", ratified
2026-07-07) and moved truth-maintenance retraction off the forward `rewriter`. This peels the retraction
callers (`retraction.retract`, `decide` phase 2) and clears one of the two gates on deleting `rewriter.py`.

- **`INTERPOSE rel obj marker` / `RESTORE rel marker obj` (machine.py).** INTERPOSE hides an edge
  REVERSIBLY: `rel -> obj` becomes `rel -> <marker> -> obj` by splicing a fresh CONTROL marker
  (`<retracted>`), so `_relation_exists` is false NATURALLY and the matcher (which skips the inert/control
  marker) never learns what retraction is. RESTORE is the exact inverse (`INTERPOSE ∘ RESTORE = id`). §5
  reframes from "no opcode mutates a fact edge" to "the sole fact-edge op preserves its pre-image — no
  IRREVERSIBLE loss"; `DROP_CTRL` still refuses facts. **Deviation from the spec's illustrative
  `assert edge_is_fact`:** interposition is reversible, hence safe on ANY live edge, so it requires only
  that the edge exists — necessary because a retractable walker shortcut is now CONTROL-stamped and the
  cascade must still hide it.

- **`rewire` → `INTERPOSE` lowering (lowering.py).** `_lower_bank_rule` no longer rejects `rewire`;
  `lower_rewire` recognizes the reversible-interposition triple `[cut(rel,obj), link(rel,m), link(m,obj)]`
  (`retraction.INTERPOSE_RULE`, the sole `rewire` in the system) and emits one `INTERPOSE`. Any other rewire
  shape (bare cut/link — test fixtures only) stays `Unlowerable`. `rewriter`'s `rewire` path is untouched,
  so `test_rewire.py` (direct-on-rewriter) still passes.

- **Per-rule provenance-awareness in `run_bank`.** A META/TMS rule that NAMES provenance (the CASCADE's
  `?j proves ?f` / `?j uses ?rel`) must SEE the inert `<j:…>` nodes that `skip_inert` hides. `run_bank` now
  builds a second `skip_inert=OFF` machine and routes each rule to it iff `rule_touches_provenance(rule)`
  (any LHS/NAC literal is inert) — exactly `rewriter`'s per-rule `match_inert` (`_pats_touch_prov`). CASCADE
  is prov-aware (sees `<j:>`); INTERPOSE names only `<retract>`/`targets`, so it keeps the fact-only view.

- **Routed `retraction.retract()` and `decide` phase 2 to `isa=True`.** The CASCADE + INTERPOSE rules now
  run on `run_bank`. Differential-clean vs `rewriter`: retracting a premise hides the fact AND cascade-hides
  its derived consequent identically on both engines (`test_isa_interpose.py`, and `test_walkers`'
  shortcut-is-retractable, `test_decide`, `test_riddles`, `test_retract_rules` all green on the ISA path).

**coref_walk still on `rewriter`, blocker now precise (distinct unit):** its `materialize_cursor` Python
helper mints the `coref_cursor` scaffolding as FACTS (`add_relation`, control=False), so the `<coref>`-gated
`ADVANCE` `drop` is `DROP_CTRL`-refused — the same tool-marker-stamp class as Phase 0.3. Unblocking it needs
the cursor scaffolding minted control in `materialize_cursor` AND validating the resulting `same_as`-as-control
divergence (COMMIT is `<coref>`-gated, like the walker shortcut). Deleting `rewriter.py` now gated on: coref
(this) + `session.py:478` rule-source recognition (semi-naive SEED, Phase 4.1).

### Phase 0.5 (cont.) — `run_bank` PROVENANCE MINTING; cpg + walker onto the ISA engine (459 tests)

Built the biggest remaining `rewriter`-peel lever — **in-graph justification minting in `run_bank`** —
and migrated the two callers it fully unblocks. Differentially gated against `rewriter.run` every step.

- **`run_bank(provenance=True)` mints justifications exactly as `rewriter._apply` does.** A firing that
  CREATES new fact relations gets a `<j:RULEKEY>` node with `proves`->each new fact and `uses`->each LHS
  premise it matched (provenance.py). Threaded through the lowering: `lower_conj`/`lower_lhs` collect the
  premise rel-node registers, `lower_rhs` the head rel-node registers, `_lower_bank_rule` returns both;
  the driver snapshots the node set before each firing so `made_facts` = head rels NEWLY created (a
  deduped/existing rel is not re-proven, the analog of `rewriter`'s `if not _relation_exists`). Provenance
  forces `skip_inert` ON (the J's it mints must be skipped by later rounds). Differential test
  `test_isa_reasoning_parity.py`: identical proven+uses structure and no re-proving of deduped facts.

- **cpg recognition → `run_bank` (`isa=True`).** `analyze`'s `RECOGNIZER_RULES`/`JOERN_RECOGNIZER_RULES`/
  `MECHANISM_RULES` are pure positive frame/hazard recognition — no provenance needed (the detector reads
  derived triples, and benches actively filter provenance leakage), so run_bank's no-provenance path is a
  cleaner fit. Differential-clean on all three fixtures (plain cpg + joern-lowered): identical derived
  triples, empty diff both ways.

- **walker → `run_bank(provenance=True)`.** `walk_on_demand` drops the seed frontier (documented
  correctness-neutral: step 1 is `force_all`) and runs the walk on the ISA engine with tool servicing
  (`dec`/`refuel` `<call>`s) + provenance. All 14 walker tests pass incl. shortcut-has-provenance and
  shortcut-is-retractable. **CLASSIFIED DIVERGENCE (ratified, not a bug):** the arrive rule binds
  `<walker>` (a control token), so by the ratified control-ness criterion the minted shortcut `a is_a d`
  is CONTROL-stamped (`edge_is_fact` False) where `rewriter` made it a plain fact. This is defensible —
  a walker shortcut is retractable MEMOIZATION of a transitive path, so control-layer (deletable) is the
  right home; provenance is still minted, so `support_js`/retraction work unchanged.

- **coref_walk migration ATTEMPTED and REVERTED (blocked, as predicted).** Its rules all lower, and the 6
  `test_coref_walk` cases pass on `run_bank`, but the SESSION single-identity/clash path `drop`s a
  `same_as` LINK (a fact edge) on reject → `run_bank`'s `DROP_CTRL` refuses it (§5), `ControlEdgeError`.
  This is the INTERPOSE-gated reversible-retraction case (`decision-interpose-opcode`), the same fact-edge
  -drop blocker as the surface path had — not a mechanical migration. Reverted; stays on `rewriter`.

**Still on `rewriter` (need capabilities not yet built):** `coref_walk` + `session` DEMAND_COREF (fact-edge
retraction → INTERPOSE opcode); `decide`/`retraction` (`rewire` → INTERPOSE); `session.py:478` rule-source
recognition (semi-naive `<fresh>` SEED → Phase 4.1); the `run_rules` `isa=False` fallback (`authoring.py:995`,
now only reached by the retraction path). Deleting `rewriter.py` is gated on the INTERPOSE opcode + Phase 4.1.

### Phase 2.2 (slice) — surface scaffolding CONTROL-typed; `normalize_surface` onto `run_bank` (457 tests)

Acting on the Phase-0.5 finding (deleting `rewriter` is gated on the recognition scaffolding being
control-typed), landed the slice of Phase 2.2 that unblocks the surface-rewriting recognition.

- **The surface `next`/`first` token chain + surface tags are now CONTROL-layer.** `tokenize` marks
  the chain control (`add_node("<sentence>", control=True)`, `add_relation(..., control=True)`);
  `run_bank` gained a `control_preds` set and `lower_rhs` a PER-ATOM control rule — a head whose
  PREDICATE is a scaffolding predicate (`forms.SCAFFOLD_PREDS = {next, first, *SURFACE_TAGS}`) mints
  control REGARDLESS of the rule, so a recognition form can read the chain and mint CONTENT facts
  (fact) while its `next`/`first` BRIDGE stays control. This is the substrate finally matching the
  intent `forms.py` always documented ("the token chain is EPHEMERAL scaffolding (control), rewriting
  it is control-deletes-control, never fact deletion").

- **`normalize_surface` moved onto `run_bank`** (determiner strip + NP decomposition). Its `drop`s of
  `next`/`first` now target CONTROL edges, so `DROP_CTRL` permits them (was `ControlEdgeError`). The
  live Session's multiword decomposition, cross-name identity, pronoun/anaphora, and universals all
  pass on the ISA engine (`test_new_core`/`test_universals`/`test_verb_catalog`). The earlier "seed
  misfire" fear was a red herring: `_strip_surface` already removes each PRIOR sentence's chain, so
  whole-graph matching only ever sees the current line — no per-sentence seed needed here.

- **Retired two obsolete tests** (`test_isa_forward.py`): `test_solve_all_recognizes_rule_source_
  identically_to_rewriter` and `test_recognition_nac_completions_are_control_and_invisible`. They
  pinned RECOGNITION through the GoalSolver (`solve_all` over forms) — a superseded exploration with
  NO production callers (recognition is `run_bank`). Control-typing the scaffolding correctly makes it
  invisible to GoalSolver's reasoning matcher (`_facts_matching` skips control, §5), so GoalSolver can
  no longer recognize over the chain — which is the intended split (recognition sees scaffolding,
  reasoning does not). Zero production impact: `_strip_surface` removes the chain before GoalSolver
  ever answers. Test 1 also differentialed against the `rewriter` being deleted. Full note in-file.

**Still on `rewriter` (need run_bank capabilities that don't exist yet):** the RULE-SOURCE
recognition (`session.py:478` — whole-graph `run_bank` double-fires the Skolem NAC-pattern form → a
duplicate NAC clause; needs the semi-naive `<fresh>` SEED frontier, Phase 4.1); the TOOL-DRIVEN
provenance passes (`walker`, `coref_walk`, `session` DEMAND_COREF — need `run_bank` provenance minting
+ seeds); and the `run_rules` `isa=False` fallback (`authoring.py:995`). 457 tests green.

### Phase 0.5 (partial) — additive recognition migrated; surface-rewriting BLOCKED on Phase 2.2 (459 tests)

Started peeling the remaining `rewriter.run` callers toward deleting `rewriter.py`, and hit a
structural wall worth recording precisely.

- **Migrated (clean):** the ADDITIVE single-line recognition callers — each builds a fresh `tmp`
  graph and only tags/reifies (no edge surgery, no cross-sentence isolation): `deontic`, `procedure`,
  `planning_kb`, `query` (its `_KW_FORMS`/`QUESTION_FORMS` runs), and the degree-graph recognition
  (`authoring.py:175`). `run(tmp, …)` → `run_bank(tmp, …)`.

- **BLOCKED — the surface-rewriting recognition cannot run on `run_bank` as built.** A trial swap of
  `normalize_surface` died with `ControlEdgeError`. The surface-normalization forms `drop` surface
  `next`/`first` **fact** edges to strip determiners and decompose noun phrases (`forms.py:67`,
  `_determiner_forms`/`_DECOMP_FORMS`) — but `run_bank`'s `DROP_CTRL` REFUSES a fact-edge deletion
  (§5 fact-immutability, the invariant we gave it teeth for in Phase 0.3). And even setting that
  aside, whole-graph `run_bank` loses the seeded incremental isolation the live Session needs
  (`session.py:473`: "re-running forms over old chains misfires" — 25 Session tests failed the
  trial). Reverted; the Session/normalize paths stay on `rewriter`.

- **The finding reorders the plan:** deleting `rewriter` is GATED on the recognition/surface
  SCAFFOLDING (tokens + the `next`/`first` chain) being CONTROL-typed — which is exactly **Phase
  2.2** ("keyword/control tokens become keys on control-flagged nodes"). Control-flag the scaffolding
  and `DROP_CTRL` PERMITS the strip/decompose rewrites, so the surface recognition moves to
  `run_bank`. **Phase 2.2 is therefore a PREREQUISITE for finishing 0.5**, not a successor. (The
  `INTERPOSE` reversible-retraction opcode — `decision-interpose-opcode` — is the alternative: it
  makes the surface rewrite a reversible interposition instead of a fact-edge delete. Either
  unblocks it; control-flagging is the cheaper, already-planned path.) A separate, smaller blocker
  for the incremental Session: `run_bank` is naive (no semi-naive SEED / `<fresh>` frontier, Phase
  4.1), so per-sentence isolation is lost — handle alongside once the scaffolding is control-typed.

Net: the substrate's fact-immutability (a Phase-0.3 win) is exactly what stops the OLD surface
recognition — which mutates fact edges freely, rewriter-style — from moving over. The peel can't
finish until the scaffolding stops pretending to be facts. 459 tests green; the clean migrations
stand.

### Phase 0.4 — graded/coref reasoning passes onto `run_bank`; dynamic-key EMIT (459 tests)

The two reasoning passes the batch loaders (`load_facts`/`load_corpus`) and the live `Session`
still ran on `rewriter.run` now run on the ISA forward `Machine`:

- **`_coref_propagation`** (`same_as` propagation over content predicates) — plain-relation rules,
  already run_bank-lowerable; `run(...)` → `run_bank(...)` at both batch-loader sites.
- **`graded_rules`** (`propagate` → embedding write) — needed a new machine capability: a
  **dynamic-key graded SET EMIT**. `EMIT` gained `key_reg` (the attribute key is the NAME of the
  node in that register, resolved at apply time — so a `propagate` whose dimension is a BOUND var
  `?adj`→"urgent" writes `embedding[name(?adj)]`) and `raise_degree=False` (SET/overwrite, the
  semantics `rewriter.set_embedding` gives, vs the monotone max-raise a derived degree uses).
  `lowering.lower_propagate` is the ISA face of `rewriter._propagate_ops` (the `set` op; a literal
  dimension takes the static-key branch). Wired into `lower_rule` + `_lower_bank_rule`; routed at
  `load_facts`, `load_corpus`, and `session._assert` (the live graded pass — no longer journaled,
  since embedding writes are not relation firings `explain` traces).

Differential-clean vs `rewriter.run`: `test_isa_reasoning_parity.py` adds dynamic-key, literal-dim,
and an end-to-end graded-pass differential (`run_bank` == `rewriter.run` on `alice is very urgent`
→ `alice.embedding[urgent] = 0.8`). 459 tests green; suite 141s→~102s (the reasoning passes now take
the Phase-0.1-optimized path).

**Scope note for Phase 0.5 (delete `rewriter.py`):** the plan's "only remaining `rewriter.run`
callers" line was optimistic. Beyond the passes just migrated, `rewriter.run` is still called by the
module-level recognition/tool passes — `deontic`, `forms`, `query`, `procedure`, `planning_kb`,
`session._surface`/DEMAND_COREF, `walker`, `coref_walk` — plus the `run_rules` `isa=False` fallback
(`authoring.py:995`) and the degree-graph recognition (`authoring.py:175`). 0.5 must migrate ALL of
these (recognition ones are Phase-0.2-shaped; the tool-driven `walker`/`coref_walk` need the
`<call>` servicing run_bank already has) before `rewriter.py` can go.

### Phase 0.3 (cont.) — planner ROUTED onto `run_bank`; reasoning parity closed (456 tests)

The blocker the entry below names is closed: `plan()`'s reasoning + control AND the replan teardown
now run on the ISA forward `Machine` (`run_rules(isa=True)`), differentially clean against
`rewriter.run`. The planner is one engine end to end (recognition + reasoning + `DROP_CTRL`
teardown). What it took:

- **Literal-endpoint INTERN + relation DEDUP** (`isa/machine.py` `MINT.intern`/`MINT.dedup`,
  `isa/lowering.py` `lower_rhs`). Recognition compared graphs as SETS of triples, which hid two
  NODE-IDENTITY properties the planner's REASONING depends on:
  - a head endpoint that is a PLAIN LITERAL now canonicalizes to its graph-wide node
    (`rewriter.apply_rule.resolve_so`'s `nodes_named(nm)[0]`), so a downstream rule joins two
    head-derived literals by identity. This was the exact `test_cards_frontier` value→plan
    divergence: the 2-clause bridge minted `buy_charizard add have_valuable` on a FRESH
    `have_valuable` node ≠ the `<need> for have_valuable` node, so `candidate`/`viable`/`chosen`
    never fired and `solve`→'stuck'. (The bridge itself fired — it was NOT a control-stamp bug, as
    the prior entry correctly diagnosed; the gap was node canonicalization.)
  - a reified relation now reuses an existing `s -[rel]-> o` (`rewriter._relation_exists`), so a
    rule re-fired across outer control cycles stops accreting duplicate rel nodes and the graph's
    EDGE set (hence `planning._fingerprint`) reaches a fixpoint instead of growing every cycle. The
    "perf regression" the prior entry flagged was mostly this accretion — with dedup the loop
    settles in the same cycle count as the rewriter, fast.
- **Tool-minted control markers stamp control** (`planning._control_relation`). `done`/`ranked`/
  `price_known` are written by §8 TOOLS via `add_relation` (fact rel nodes); `DROP_CTRL` teardown
  would refuse them. The tool now stamps the rel node control when it targets a `<…>` token —
  content-blind (the reserved `<…>` syntax, the same criterion as `lowering._is_control_token`),
  never a predicate list. A fact a tool writes (`cheaper_than`, a price result) points at a domain
  node and stays a fact. (Under the rewriter's regardless-of-layer teardown the stamp is harmless.)
- Differential proof: `run_bank` == `rewriter.run` on the cards-frontier value→plan scenario
  (derived triples, `chosen` operators, and cycle count all identical). New regression tests
  `tests/test_isa_reasoning_parity.py` (4) pin INTERN, DEDUP, two-producer sharing, and the
  two-clause bridge differential. 456 tests green; `isa=True` is now LIVE at `plan()`/teardown.

Remaining `rewriter.run` callers: the reasoning passes (`_coref_propagation`, `graded_rules`) =
Phase 0.4 (needs a dynamic-key EMIT for `propagate`), then `rewriter.py` deletes (Phase 0.5).

### Phase 0.3 — control-layer machine capabilities built + tested; planner routing BLOCKED (452 tests)

The opcode/lowering machinery for putting the planner's control layer on the ISA `Machine` is built
and unit-tested (`tests/test_isa_drop.py`, 3 tests), but ROUTING the planner/teardown to it is gated
on run_bank reaching REASONING parity with `rewriter.run`. What landed (all off the default path;
`isa=True` driver is OFF):

- **Control-stamp at MINT** (`isa/lowering.py` `_rule_touches_control` + `lower_rhs`). A relation
  minted by a rule that references a `<…>` control token is flagged `control` at MINT. This is the
  producer-side, content-blind criterion — established INDEPENDENTLY of any `drop` rule, so
  `DROP_CTRL`'s fact-edge refusal keeps its teeth (a fact minted by a control-free rule stays a fact
  and its deletion is refused). **Design ratified with the user against `vision.md`**: control-ness
  = the reserved `<…>` syntax (forms.py/lint.py already treat it as reserved machinery) + structural
  propagation, NEVER a domain-predicate list in Python (the "no python logic" bright line). The §1
  "substrate doesn't distinguish control tokens" tension resolves via the §1 amendment (control-ness
  IS a borne attribute) + Phase 2.2 ("control tokens become keys on control-flagged nodes"). It
  strengthens §12.3: the lint-time "control rule must be gated" invariant becomes engine-enforced.

- **`drop` → DROP_CTRL** (`isa/lowering.py` `lower_drop`, wired in `_lower_bank_rule`/`run_bank`). A
  control rule's `drop` deletes a reified relation via `DROP_CTRL` over both bare edges (seeded from
  the LHS-bound endpoints, df-optimal); run_bank gc's the orphaned control rel node (matching
  `rewriter._remove_relation`). `rewire`/`propagate` still raise `Unlowerable`.

- **`<call>` tool servicing in `run_bank`** (`tools=` param; services pending `<call>`s at each
  rule-fixpoint via `dispatch.service_calls`, exactly `rewriter.run`'s loop). No provenance minted
  (parity with the planner's `provenance=False` path).

- **`run_rules(isa=True)`** opt-in per-stratum `run_bank` driver (`authoring.py`), OFF by default.

**Why routing is blocked (the honest gate):** stamping control at mint needs the PLANNER to mint on
run_bank. A trial `isa=True` at `plan()`/teardown surfaced (a) a correctness divergence —
`test_cards_frontier`'s value→plan bridge `solve` returns 'stuck' not 'done' (the 2-clause
`?o add have_valuable when ?o acts_on ?c and ?c is valuable` bridge has NO control tokens, so it is
a baseline run_bank REASONING-parity gap, not a control-stamp bug) — and (b) a perf regression
(run_bank is naive; no semi-naive/seeds). run_bank's RECOGNITION parity is proven; its REASONING
parity with `rewriter.run` on the planner+card-trader banks is the open gap the docs always named
(GoalSolver/run_bank "prove SEMANTICS not SPEED"). So `isa=True` is OFF everywhere; the planner
stays on the rewriter. `implementation_plan.md` Phase 0.3 — NEXT: close run_bank reasoning parity,
then flip the flag.

### Phase 0.2 — the four rule loaders recognize on `run_bank` (449 tests, suite 99s→82s)

The perf gate Phase 0.1 lifted was the only thing keeping RULE recognition on `rewriter.run`. All
four rule loaders now fold their CNL surface into `Rule` structure via `run_bank` (the ISA forward
`Machine`), matching `load_facts`/`load_corpus` which were already there:

- `authoring.load_rules` (native rule CNL), `authoring.load_universal_rules` (`if/then` NL
  universals), `authoring.load_loose_rules` (loose imperative CNL): `run(rg, …)` → `run_bank(rg, …)`.
- `machine_rules.load_machine_rules` (planner/control CNL — the perf-heavy `planning.cnl` bank):
  `run(rg, MACHINE_RULE_FORMS)` → `run_bank(…)`; the `from .rewriter import run` import dropped
  (no other `rewriter` use in that module).

Licensed by the existing whole-batch + per-sentence differential tests (`test_isa_runbank.py`):
`run_bank(_ALL_FORMS)` reproduces `rewriter.run` EXACTLY on recognized rule shapes across the
diverse corpus (every recognition form is a subset of `_ALL_FORMS`). 449 tests green, no output
change; the suite dropped 99s→82s (the machine-rule loaders now run the Phase-0.1-optimized path).

Remaining `rewriter.run` callers: the reasoning passes (`_coref_propagation`, `graded_rules` in
`load_facts`/`load_corpus`) = Phase 0.4, and the planner teardown `drop`s = Phase 0.3.
`implementation_plan.md` Phase 0.2.

## 2026-07-07

### Phase 0.1 — `run_bank` perf: df-seeding + bound-endpoint join driving (449 tests, 34× faster)

The gate everything in Phase 0 waits behind (the loader swap off `rewriter`). `run_bank` was ~89× slower than
`rewriter.run` on a large machine-rule bank (`planning.cnl`: 9.6s vs 108ms). TWO content-blind, semantically
transparent wins — each differential-tested green vs `rewriter.run` at every step (`test_isa_runbank.py`) — took
it to **2.6× on `planning.cnl` (273ms)** and **1.0–5.1× across all ten CNL banks, every output IDENTICAL**:

- **Name-index SEED fast path** (`isa/machine.py`). A `SEED(reg, name, "=", X)` was scanning EVERY named node
  (`nodes_with_key("name")`) and comparing values one by one — 8.6M `_valued_ok`/`get_attr` calls. It now hits the
  O(1) lexical accelerator `nodes_named(X)` (the KB-blessed discriminating index, Phase 2.3 — `nodes_named`/
  `name_count` exist precisely as "the selectivity the matcher seeds from"). Semantically transparent: `_by_name`
  is kept in sync with the always-VALUED NAME attr, so the candidate set is identical to the scan. Guarded on a
  `str` value so a hypothetical non-string name SEED falls back to the scan. Cut 88.8× → 33.1×.
- **Drive the join from the bound endpoint** (`isa/lowering.py`, `lower_conj`). A literal-predicate pattern like
  `(?co, next, and?)` whose subject an earlier pattern already bound was doing a FRESH `SEED next` over all ~200
  `next` nodes then a `SAME` to reconnect — a cross-product blowup (`body.and`: 26k intermediate states → 25 final;
  four `body.and.ellipsis*` rules: 16k steps each → ZERO results). It now reaches the rel node by `FOLLOW`ing from
  the bound (rarest, specific) endpoint + a name `TEST`. The set is identical (`{rel : edge(s,rel) ∧ name(rel)=p}`)
  because a conjunction match is a relational join — order-independent in its result SET — so this is the df-optimal
  join order, not a semantic change. Cut 33.1× → 2.6×; intra-match `_match_step` calls 3.86M → 243k.

The remaining factor is pure cross-round re-matching (~16 rounds; the semi-naive/`<fresh>` change-frontier, win #3 —
not yet needed: absolute times are ≤240ms and the intra-match pathology is gone). This lifts the perf blocker the
loaders' `rewriter`-swap (Phase 0.2) waited on. decision-attrgraph-rehost; `implementation_plan.md` Phase 0.1.

### AttrGraph re-host, item #3 sub-item (i) — recognition-NAC completions demoted to CONTROL-layer (441 tests)

The flagged residual for #3 (recognition off `rewriter`). Running the FORM rules through the `GoalSolver`
forward driver (`solve_all`) lowers their guard NACs to demand-completions whose NEGATIVES (`is_kw_not`/
`is_bnd_not`/`kw_not_not`) are pure surface scaffolding — the forward `rewriter` never materializes them
(its NAC is a match-time check), so the ISA driver over-produced visible facts. Fixed domain-blind, with
one boolean and no predicate list (`isa/goal.py`, `isa/attrgraph.py`):

- **`control_completions` flag** on `GoalSolver`/`solve_all` (default False). A RECOGNITION solve passes
  True → `_complete_negative` marks the materialized negative `control=True` (nested solvers inherit it).
  A REASONING solve leaves it False → `is_not P`/`overridden_not …` stay REAL facts consumers match
  positively (the `decide` line).
- **`_facts_matching` skips CONTROL relation nodes** (all 3 branches) — a demoted completion is invisible
  to fact matching structurally, not just by naming convention. Safe for recognition itself (a NAC negative
  is answered by `_complete_negative`'s cache, never re-read via `_facts_matching`); full suite green, so no
  reasoning path relied on a control node being matchable.
- **`AttrGraph.set_control(nid, flag=True)`** added (complements read-only `is_control`).
- Recognized `Rule`s stay BYTE-IDENTICAL to `rewriter` (the completions are NAC scaffolding, never read by
  `expand_rules`); the positive guard fact `kw_not` correctly stays visible (rewriter emits it too). New test
  `test_recognition_nac_completions_are_control_and_invisible` pins that the flag (not the predicate) demotes,
  and that a reasoning enumeration of a control completion returns nothing. decision-attrgraph-rehost.

### AttrGraph re-host, item #3 — GoalSolver gains value-invention + bound-literal pinning; recognition ports to the ISA (439 tests)

Toward "move the reasoning MECHANISMS out of `rewriter` so the ISA is the only engine" (user framing:
`FORM_RULES` may stay Python, but NAC/`propagate→EMIT`/interpose must not live in `rewriter`). Empirically
established that recognition runs on `solve_all` (the GoalSolver forward driver) — its NAC handling is
*already* the ISA's (NAC-as-completion, byte-for-byte with `rewriter.nac_blocks` on the `in`/last-token
guards). Diagnosing rule-source recognition surfaced TWO real gaps in the demand-driven engine, both now
fixed (`isa/goal.py`):

- **Skolem / value-invention.** A `<...>?` head token (`<cond>?`/`<rule>?`/`<use>?`) is a FRESH node per
  firing (what `rewriter.apply_rule`'s `fresh` dict and the ISA `MINT` do); `GoalSolver._materialize`
  resolved it BY NAME → one shared node → every clause of a rule collided into one mangled `<cond>`.
  Added `_head_endpoint`/`_skolem` — a `<...>?` head mints a fresh node keyed by `(rule, token, env)`, so a
  rule's RHS clauses share one node per firing, distinct firings stay distinct, and re-derivation is
  idempotent (shared across nested solvers). `_materialize` returns the rel node; `_is_skolem` gates on the
  `<`-prefixed bound-literal (excludes name-keywords `is?`/`a?` and bare singletons `<closed_world>`).
- **Bound-literal pinning.** `is?`/`a?` were matched BY NAME independently per body clause, so
  `?cs next is?, is? next a?` floated over every `is` node — a cross-product that duplicated clauses when a
  rule had several `is` tokens (fact recognition escaped it: one `is` per sentence). `_extend`/`_resolve`
  now treat a bound-literal as a NAME-CONSTRAINED variable: match the name, then PIN the node so later
  occurrences reference the same one (as `rewriter` binds it).

VALIDATED: rule-source recognition compiles byte-for-byte identical `Rule`s via `solve_all` vs `rewriter`
across 4 rule shapes + a full mixed corpus (the thief NAC rule, multi-clause `and` bodies, graded); fact
recognition already matched; **full suite 439 green (no reasoning regression from the core-binding change).**
Residual (a smaller follow-up): `solve_all` leaves the materialized recognition-NAC completions (`is_kw_not`
/`is_bnd_not`) as visible scaffolding facts — harmless to rule/fact output, but should be marked
control-layer so they can't pollute reasoning. Then recognition can move off `rewriter` for real.

### AttrGraph re-host, item #4 unblock — backward-engine PROVENANCE + contract oracle on the backward path (439 tests)

The load-bearing enabler for retiring `decide`/retraction (the §5 payoff): the backward ISA engine now
MINTs provenance, so `why` works on backward-materialized graphs, so the closed-world consumers can move
off `decide.solve` (whose phase-2 retraction is the last production fact-edge cut).

- **DISCOVERY (corrects the earlier scoping):** `decide.solve` phase-2 retraction is NOT reached only by
  one deliberate test — its aggressive completion over-asserts `is_not P` for EVERY closed-world entity
  (e.g. `ada`/`bo` both get `is_not cleared` → both "thief"), and phase-2 retraction is what repairs it.
  So retraction is load-bearing for ALL forward closed-world consumers; they must move to the backward
  engine's NON-aggressive demand-completion, which needs provenance for `why`. `explain`/`why` already
  reads IN-GRAPH `proves`/`uses` (not a journal, `surface.explain`), but `GoalSolver` never minted it.
- **`GoalSolver` provenance MINT** (`isa/goal.py`, `provenance=` flag, default off): when a rule
  materializes a head, mint `<j:rulekey>` + `proves→head` + `uses→each positive body clause's relation
  node` — the SAME substrate trace `rewriter.run` writes, deduped per (fact, rule) across semi-naive
  rounds/nested solves (`_justified`, threaded like `_materialized`). `_materialize` now returns the
  relation node id (+ `_rel_node` memo); `_find_fact_node`/`_justify` added; nested completion/∃ solvers
  inherit the flag. `solve_all(..., provenance=True)` exposes it. `provenance` import is lazy (avoids a
  `provenance → world_model → isa` cycle).
- **`load_corpus(..., decided_negation=False)`**: threads the plain-NAC compilation (no `decide`
  aggressive-completion rule) so the backward engine completes closed-world negation on demand.
- **Contract + riddles oracles migrated** to the backward engine (`test_contract.py`, `test_riddles.py`):
  `load_corpus(..., decided_negation=False)` + `solve_all(..., provenance=True)`. Same public contract
  (unique culprit, `why` names the elimination + `cleared`, the negative explained as a completion) with
  NO retraction / fact-edge cut. `_complete_negative` mints a premise-less `<j:complete.REL>` so a `why`
  on a closed-world negative renders the elimination step. `test_riddles_author_entirely_in_cnl` re-homed
  to the backward form (thief rule KEEPS its NAC; no generated aggressive-completion rule); the intermediate
  `positive_holds`/`negative_holds` checks made node-agnostic (any coref mention) since the node-level
  engine materializes on the same_as-class canonical.

- **§5 REFRAMED (user, 2026-07-07):** retraction-by-INTERPOSITION (`retraction.py`: `cut ?rel→?o` +
  relink through the inert `<retracted>` marker) is REVERSIBLE and marker-recorded — the fact node
  persists and the edge is reconstructible — so it is NOT the fact-LOSS §5 forbids. The invariant worth
  protecting is "the monotone reasoning fixpoint never loses a derived fact," which the backward engine
  satisfies BY CONSTRUCTION; the reversible `h.retract` belief-revision tool is a sanctioned control op,
  NOT a violation. Consequence: the planned blanket "`remove_*` refuses fact edges" guard is the WRONG
  shape (it would forbid the legitimate reversible rewire) and is DROPPED. `retraction.py` + `decide` +
  their tests STAY. The re-host retires the forward machinery for the OTHER arc reasons (domain-blind
  engine, goal-direction, one substrate), moving reasoning onto the backward ISA engine — not because
  retraction breaks §5. A future rule-based `<reconsider>` (un-splice on new evidence, `<retracted>` as
  KB vocabulary) would make belief revision pure banks, no machinery.

### AttrGraph re-host, Phase C item #1 FINISHED — `canonicalize` retired from BOTH load paths (438 tests)

The LAST fact-deletion in the loaders is gone: `authoring.load_facts` and `load_corpus` no longer call
the destructive `forms.canonicalize` node-MERGE. Coreference is now the additive `wire_same_as` link +
`same_as` propagation — §5-safe (only adds edges, never deletes a fact). (`decision-attrgraph-rehost`,
handoff item #1; the `Session._merge_unique` slice landed earlier the same day.)

- **`load_facts`**: `wire_same_as` → `run(_coref_propagation)` (compose facts across the links, so
  `urgent is gradable` reaches the surface `urgent` token of `alice is very urgent` before the graded
  rule fires) → `graded_rules` → **`forms.propagate_embeddings`** (NEW: unions graded/embedding attrs
  across each `same_as` class — the GRADED-layer counterpart of `same_as_rules`, a §8 tool since the
  path language can't join on embedding attrs, so degrees spread to every coreferent mention).
- **`load_corpus`**: same recipe, PLUS the returned `rules` now APPEND the `same_as` propagation so the
  forward `run_rules(kb, rules)` consumers (contract/cards/riddles) compose derived facts across links
  live (the merge gave that permanently). `closes` added to the propagation predicate set so a
  closed-world marker reaches a rule's `is not P` clause before `expand_rules` reflects it.
- **`GoalSolver` skips `same_as` propagation rules** (`_is_same_as_prop`): the node-level engine follows
  a `same_as` class natively (union-find in `_facts_matching`), so the copy rules are redundant — dropped
  at intake. This kept the ISA `solve_all`/`ask_goal` path fast (the appended propagation had ~2×'d those
  tests; suite back to ~53s) and re-confirms node-level == forward-propagation at the answer level.
- Internal-coupled `test_new_core` re-homes (additive coref replicates a derived fact across an entity's
  mentions): `outcome`/`served`/`placed`/`custs` helpers dedupe with a set; two raw-`run_rules` tests
  now bundle `same_as_rules` as the Session's reasoning bank does; the corpus `keys` assertion filters
  the appended propagation. `canonicalize` is now DEFINED but UNCALLED in production (test-only; a Phase
  D delete). Next §5 step — the `remove_*`-refuses-fact-edges GUARD — is gated on retiring the still-live
  `decide`/`retraction` interpose (the one remaining production fact-edge cut, item #4).

### ISA arc — deeper walker integration (a deferred non-arc slice, 423 tests)

With both honest-gate speed wins in (below), picked up the first deferred non-arc slice: generalizing
the long-range walker demand beyond the pure same-relation transitive-closure shape
(`harneskills/isa/{walker,goal}.py`; `tests/test_isa_goal_walker_linear.py`, 8 tests).

- **Linear recursion over a DIFFERENT base relation.** `goal._closure_bases` maps a derived relation
  that is the transitive closure of a base — `anc(a,b):-parent(a,b)`, `anc(a,c):-parent(a,b),anc(b,c)`
  (left- OR right-recursive step) — to that base. `Walker` gained a `mint_rel` so it WALKS the base
  (`parent`) while materializing the discovered shortcut AS the derived relation (`anc`) — walk one
  relation, mint another. A relation is only treated as walkable when its head rules are EXACTLY
  {base, step}; any other contributor to it would be a derivation a base-edge walk cannot see, so we
  fall back to tabling (completeness before speed).
- **A walker for an INTERIOR reachability subgoal.** `_walk_applicable` now fires for a ground
  reachability subgoal arising *inside* a larger tabled query (the check moved into the fixpoint loop,
  a `_walked_goals` set makes it once-only), so a body clause like `anc(?x,?y)` with both ends
  SIP-bound is carried by a walker instead of the tabled chain, materializing only the shortcut.
- **Soundness fix the generalization surfaced.** A transitive-closure walker answers ≥1 hop, so a
  reflexive `rel(a,a)` holds ONLY via a real cycle — the old `subj==obj` 0-hop short-circuit was
  latently unsound (it claimed reflexive reachability with no cycle, diverging from tabling). The
  target check now runs before the visited-skip so a ≥1-hop path back to the source is found, and the
  path reconstruction handles the cycle. Pinned on cyclic graphs for BOTH the linear and the
  same-relation shapes.

All differential-tested against tabling (the trusted oracle, itself validated against the forward
closure): agreement left- and right-recursive, fuel bounds the reach, free-object goals still table,
the interior subgoal is walked, and a 300+-pair random sweep over cyclic `parent` graphs (incl. every
reflexive pair) matches tabling exactly. 423 tests green. Uncommitted on top of `a31e264`. Memory
`finding-isa-reference-machine`.

### ISA arc, the HONEST GATE — semi-naïve delta parity (slice 2 of 3, 415 tests)

The second speed-parity win, on top of seed-from-ground (below). `GoalSolver.solve` was a naive
`while changed` fixpoint that re-joined every demanded goal's WHOLE body every round, rediscovering
answers it already had — the O(rounds) round-churn that kept the transitive-chain curve ~O(n^3.8).
Now `solve` is **semi-naïve** (`harneskills/isa/goal.py`): a goal's body is joined in FULL exactly
once — its first evaluation, the seed (`self._full_joined`) — and thereafter only against the previous
round's DELTA (`self._delta_by_rel`) via the new `_delta_join`/`_delta_matching` (the classic
delta-substitution — for each body-clause position that clause draws from the delta while the others
stay full). Work drops to ~proportional-to-derivations instead of rounds × closure.

The careful part the design flagged: answers flow through BOTH the join tables AND the graph
side-channel (`_facts_matching` reads materialized facts across DIFFERENT table entries on the same
relation). Correctness is kept by folding EVERY table growth of a round into `next_new` — whether a
join derived it or `_facts_matching` picked up a cross-materialized graph fact — so the delta
propagates through both channels and no derivation is dropped (the arc's "correctness never traded"
invariant). MEASURED (walker disabled, pure tabling): n=50 2.27s → 0.59s, **n=80 15s → 2.9s** (~5× on
top of slice 1, ~37× vs the original 107s); exponent ~O(n^3.8) → ~O(n^2.9), one full power of n gone.

PROVEN answer-preserving (`tests/test_isa_goal_semi_naive.py`, 3 tests): a randomized differential
test sweeps >1000 goals across ~25 random interacting-rule programs (transitivity + linear recursion
over a DIFFERENT base relation + a two-relation join) and asserts each demand-driven answer equals the
FORWARD CLOSURE (`run_to_fixpoint`, the independent oracle) filtered to that goal — the strong catch
for a silent dropped delta; a structural pin asserts each goal is full-joined at most once
(`solver.full_joins <= #demanded goals`, non-flaky proof the round-churn is gone). All 415 tests green;
the suite got FASTER (48s → 38s). With both speed wins in, the honest gate is no longer blocked on the
goal-solver's asymptotics — retiring `rewriter.run` is now a re-hosting + deletion pass. Uncommitted on
top of `a31e264`. Memory `finding-isa-reference-machine`.

### ISA arc, the HONEST GATE — seed-from-ground parity (slice 1 of 3, 412 tests)

The ISA arc is semantically complete on the planner; the remaining move is the honest gate — the
reference `GoalSolver` proves SEMANTICS, not SPEED, so it cannot retire `rewriter.run` until it reaches
production parity (the three named wins: df-indexed rarest-anchor SEED, hub-flooding avoidance,
semi-naïve delta). A scaling probe measured the gap honestly: pure tabling on a transitive-closure
chain is ~O(n⁴) — n=40 → 4s, **n=80 → 107s**. Profiling pinned the cause: `derived_triples` (an
O(graph) rebuild of the whole triple set) called ~197k times for one n=40 solve, because every
`_materialize` bumps `AttrGraph.version` and invalidates its cache mid-derivation.

Landed the FIRST parity win — **seed from the ground endpoint** (`harneskills/isa/goal.py`;
`tests/test_isa_goal_seed.py`, 5 tests): `_facts_matching` now traverses LOCALLY from the bound
subject/object's edges (a relation `s -[rel]-> o` is a rel-node named `rel`) — O(degree), not
O(graph) — the same seed-from-ground discipline `rewriter._match` uses. Only a fully-unbound goal (an
inherent free-variable enumeration) falls back to a scan. `_materialize` went local too, plus a shared
`_materialized` memo (the monotone graph makes a repeat write an O(1) set hit). MEASURED: a
bound-endpoint solve now makes ZERO `derived_triples` scans (pinned by test); n=80 tabling **107s →
~15s** (~7×), and the O(graph)-scan-per-subgoal the profiling flagged as THE dominant cost is gone.
Exactly answer-preserving — all differential tests (`test_isa_solve*`, `test_isa_goal_predicate_nac`,
…) stay green, so this is purely the SPEED gate, answers unchanged. REMAINS: **semi-naïve delta** (the
naive fixpoint re-joins every goal every round; ~O(n^3.8) round-churn) — the next honest-gate slice,
and a careful one (answers flow through both the tables AND the graph side-channel, so a delta driver
must propagate through both without a silent incompleteness). Detail: `docs/graph low level
machine/isa-reference.md` ("The honest gate — seed from the ground endpoint").

### ISA arc, Phase 3 — the goal-directed planner, complete on a non-toy bank (407 tests)

Phase 3 remainder landed on top of the core (below). (1) The §8 rank `<call>` tool serviced
GOAL-DIRECTED: `GoalSolver` gained a `tools` registry — a TOOL-BACKED relation → a calculator `f(ag)`
run ONCE the first time a subgoal on that relation is demanded, materializing its facts. `cheaper_than`
is backed by `isa/solve.rank_cheaper_than` (AttrGraph-native cost comparison), so a `dominated` subgoal
demands the ordering → the tool mints `cheaper_than` → `dominated`/`best` complete. A COST preference
(chain step 1) now breaks a tie by cost, not the arbitrary fallback — `examples/coffee.py` (fetch(1)
beats deliver(5), dead buy_latte pruned, multi-need commitment) reproduces `plan()` exactly.

(2) The CARD-TRADER stress case (`tests/test_isa_solve_cards.py`, the non-toy target): `run_to_goal`
drives the real `corpus/cards_frontier_kb.cnl` + value→plan bridge + full `POLICY_RULES` deontic
override. The value→plan BRIDGE (reasoning DERIVES an operator effect, `?o add have_valuable when ?o
acts_on ?c and ?c is valuable`) is observed by the act loop via demand-forward add-resolution
(`_observe_simulated` demands `add(op, ?)` over the reasoning bank, so DERIVED effects reach `<now>`,
not just base facts); object-scoped deontic exclusion (a predicate-NAC completion) and its defeasible
override both work on the demand path. As predicted, no engine limits — one integration point (derived
effects at the act boundary). The ISA arc is now SEMANTICALLY COMPLETE on the planner; what remains is
the honest gate (production parity to retire `rewriter.run`).

### ISA arc, Phase 3 CORE — the goal-directed planner (plan → act → replan) (400 tests)

`harneskills/isa/solve.py`, `tests/test_isa_solve.py` (9). The forward `plan()`/`solve()` loop
SATURATES; this drives the SAME `PLANNING_RULES`/`SOLVE_RULES` through `GoalSolver` demand-forward — a
goal PULLS only its AND-OR chain (measured: goal-directed `reachable` is a STRICT SUBSET of forward's,
never the goal fact it doesn't need). Everything but `chosen` lowers to Phase-1/2 completion; the driver
owns only the selection. `derive_plan` demands `best` (pulling need/candidate/viable/cost_settled/
dominated along the chain), runs the `chosen` SELECTION per need, commits `chosen`, demands `before`.

The `chosen` selection is the ratified resolution CHAIN: preferences (the `dominated`/`best` CNL) resolve
a unique best DETERMINISTICALLY (mostly SUBSUMED, like `DROP_CTRL`); a genuine tie → a KB-prescribed
`tie_break` `<call>` (§8 seam); else a DETERMINISTIC-ARBITRARY pick (stable order, not RNG — reproducible/
provenance-safe). No operational policy hidden in the driver.

`run_to_goal` folds act/observe + replan. Control (`chosen`/`done`/viable/ready/…) is DRIVER-held and
injected into a fresh per-cycle `AttrGraph`; the persistent name-`Graph` carries ONLY monotone facts
(operators + goal + observed `<now> true`). So the forward engine's whole control-TEARDOWN bank
(`planning_teardown.cnl`, 15 gated drops) is SUBSUMED — a replan is a driver-state reset; nothing
control-layer is ever persisted, so there is nothing to tear down (the `DROP_CTRL` subsumption of Phase 2,
now for the entire replan machinery). Acting reuses `planning._perform_op`. Differential-tested vs
`planning.solve` (happy → `done`, withheld-effect divergence → replan → `done`, dead goal → `stuck`) +
the direction-preservation and teardown-subsumed gates the parity oracle is blind to.

PERF (pure, no semantics): `AttrGraph.version` (monotonic mutation counter) + a version-keyed
`derived_triples` memo (returns a frozenset). The goal solver snapshots per subgoal across many nested
solvers (~38k full-graph scans for one small plan → the dominant cost); the cache cut a plan derivation
~12.7s → sub-second and the ISA test bucket ~18s → ~4s. Phase 3 REMAINDER (not built): the rank `<call>`
tool serviced goal-directed (cost-based preference), then the card-trader `have_valuable` stress case.

### ISA arc, Phase 2 — existential NACs + `DROP_CTRL` subsumed (390 tests)

The planner's ground negation shapes now lower goal-directed. `harneskills/isa/goal.py`, additive,
NO shipped-engine change. `_lower_nac` PARTITIONS a rule's NACs by whether a clause introduces a
NAC-LOCAL free var (a binder the positive LHS does not bind): fully-bound stays the Phase-1 ground
`R_not` completion path; a free var makes the clause EXISTENTIAL, grouped by shared free var
(`_nac_groups_free`, the forward engine's `not (A and B)` vs `not A and not B` partition) and applied
per env as a demand-driven EMPTINESS check (`_exist_nac_blocks`/`_group_satisfiable` — the group
joined and solved to COMPLETION in a nested solve, same soundness discipline as `_complete_negative`).
This lifts both shapes Phase 1 rejected: ¬∃p `not ?o blocked_by ?anyp` (variable object) and grouped
¬∃x `not ?x A and not ?x B` (shared free subject). Fixed a Phase-1 over-strictness: `not ?a consume
?b` with `?b` LHS-bound is a GROUND NAC, not ¬∃ (only a NAC-LOCAL free var makes a clause existential).

**`DROP_CTRL` is SUBSUMED, not needed** — the load-bearing finding. The block/unblock idiom's
`drop ?o blocked_by ?p …` control retraction exists only to undo a block the FORWARD engine asserts
prematurely; on the demand path `blocked_by` is computed against COMPLETE reachability, so no stale
block is ever asserted and the `drop` rule (empty rhs) is INERT on the goal path. DIFFERENTIAL-TESTED
against the ACTUAL planner driver — the repeat-`run_rules`-until-stable loop of `planning.plan`, where
`drop` IS load-bearing — over a 2-step precondition chain: the goal solver reproduces the loop's final
`viable`={opa,opb} / `reachable`={water,coffee,done} exactly, `blocked_by` empty in both. (A lone
stratified `run_rules` sweep UNDER-derives — the mutual viable↔reachable recursion needs the loop.)

**The one Phase-3 residual, isolated.** The `chosen` commit rule's grouped NAC references its OWN head
(`not ?x chosen …`): a non-stratified SELECTION the forward engine resolves by commit-ORDER, not
completion. `_lower_nac` REJECTS it (a grouped existential NAC whose predicate == a head predicate) —
never silently mis-answers. Loading the WHOLE `corpus/planning.cnl` bank raises on exactly this one
rule; every other planner rule lowers. Phase 3's remaining scope is precisely operational choice for
`chosen`. `tests/test_isa_goal_existential_nac.py` (10); `test_isa_goal_nac.py` updated (9). Docs:
`isa-reference.md`, `isa-card-trader-coverage.md`. Memory `finding-isa-reference-machine`.

### ISA arc, Phase 0 + Phase 1 — predicate-NAC generalization on the goal path (380 tests)

The ISA migration's first two phases (handoff "Next step"): make hardcoding structurally impossible
by moving reasoning onto the label-less / goal-directed machine, with the card-trader banks as the
differential-test oracle.

- **Phase 0 — the coverage map** (`docs/graph low level machine/isa-card-trader-coverage.md`). Every
  card-trader bank's rules (`policy`/`risk`/`preference`/`cards_reasoning`/`planning`) against the
  opcode set, each row marked COVERED / PHASE 1 / PHASE 2 / PHASE 3. The bulk of the domain reasoning
  (positive conjunction, transitive closure, graded α-cut, MINT reification) was already covered; the
  load-bearing gap was NAC on relation markers.

- **Phase 1 — predicate-NAC completion** (`harneskills/isa/goal.py`). The NAC→materialized-positive
  completion (previously copula-only, `not ?c is P` → `is_not`) generalizes with NO new mechanism to
  an arbitrary relation marker: `_lower_nac` rewrites `not ?s R o` → a positive body clause
  `?s R_not o` (the copula is just `R = is`), records `_neg_of[R_not] = R`, and `_complete_negative`
  answers a demanded `R_not(c, P)` by the same nested-complete-solve of `R(c, P)`. The nested solver
  is now handed the `_neg_of` map (its rules are already lowered, so it can't rebuild it). This
  covers the card trader's whole negation surface — `overridden`, `stance`, `excluded`, `reachable`,
  `needs_price`, `ranked`, `dominated`, `best`. Out of slice, **rejected explicitly** (never silent):
  a variable-object NAC (`not ?o blocked_by ?anyp`, ¬∃o) and a NAC subject the body never binds
  (`not ?x chosen <yes>`, ¬∃x) — the grouped existentials, deferred to Phase 2.

- **Differential-tested against the STRATIFIED forward driver** (`authoring.run_rules`, NOT
  `rewriter.run`) on the REAL banks (`tests/test_isa_goal_predicate_nac.py`, 6 tests): the
  `preference.cnl` stance rules (where `neutral` is a DEFAULT defended by two ground NACs) and the
  full `policy.cnl` override bank. The goal-directed completion reproduces the stratified answer
  EXACTLY, including the demo's keystone (`today outranks standing` → `sell overridden` → the
  exclusion lifted). Why the stratified driver is the oracle: `rewriter.run` is a naive single
  fixpoint that evaluates a NAC against a partial graph, so it derives the unsound `op stance neutral`
  alongside `op stance encouraged`; the completion's nested-complete-solve is the goal-directed
  analog of stratifying the producer below the consumer, which is what makes it sound.

- **`isa-reference.md`** gained a "Predicate-NAC generalization (DONE)" subsection + a Phase-2 entry
  atop "Next slice". `test_isa_goal_nac.py` renamed/clarified: a relational GROUND-object NAC now
  lowers (no longer rejected); only the existential shapes (¬∃o, ¬∃s) are rejected — two tests pin
  each. Memory `finding-isa-reference-machine` updated.

### ISA goal path — NAC → materialized-positive completion (the last reasoning piece, 333 tests)

The goal-directed evaluator (`harneskills/isa/goal.py`) now handles negation, closing the goal path over
contract scenario 1 (graded routing + a NAC-gated default a derived fact defeats). Negation is NOT a
CHECK-ABSENT filter — it is the `decide` line on the demand-driven path (`memory/decision_forcing_a_decision`,
`harneskills/decide.py`):

- **`_lower_nac`** rewrites a rule's copula NAC `H :- BODY, not ?c is P` into a POSITIVE body clause
  `?c is_not P`, appended AFTER the positive LHS so the residual grounds the subject before the `is_not`
  subgoal is demanded. Only the copula `is` lowers this slice; a relational/variable-object NAC raises
  `NonStratifiable` (explicit, never a silent drop). Idempotent, so a nested solve re-lowering already-lowered
  rules is a no-op.
- **`_complete_negative`** is the single demand-driven producer for `is_not` goals: to answer `is_not(c, P)`,
  solve the positive `is(c, P)` to COMPLETION in a self-contained nested `GoalSolver`; materialize `c is_not P`
  (matched positively everywhere else) iff the positive has no answer, else answer nothing (the derived positive
  DEFEATS the default directly — no separate TMS pass on the goal path). The matching core stays PURELY POSITIVE.
- **Soundness.** The nested solve computes the positive's COMPLETE extension independently of the outer fixpoint
  round, so reading "the positive failed" is sound (the classic NAF-in-a-fixpoint bug — empty merely because a
  producer hadn't run — cannot occur). A negative cycle (`is(x,p) :- q(x), not is(x,p)`) is caught by the
  `_completing` up-stack guard → `NonStratifiable`. Stratified-only by design (`vision.md` §11).
- **`_materialize`** hardened to mint-and-register a missing endpoint node: a completion object like `urgent` may
  live only as a rule literal (never a base node), and the reified `c is_not urgent` must still anchor to a
  `urgent` node. Names are unique in this KB setting, so mint-if-absent is idempotent.

`tests/test_isa_goal_nac.py` (8): reproduces scenario 1's routing goal-directed (alice→express not regular;
bob→regular not express), pins that the negative is minted + matched positively and stays demand-scoped, and that
relational / negative-cycle NACs are rejected. Memory `finding-isa-reference-machine` extended.

### Rule ISA — the cheap experiment BUILT: label-less attribute substrate + reference machine (299 tests)

Built the go/no-go artifact of `docs/graph low level machine/rule-isa-design.md` (the label-less-substrate
revision) and `memory/decision_labelless_substrate`: the opcode set as a small-step operational semantics
plus a runnable reference interpreter, exercised by HAND-WRITTEN instruction sequences — no rules, no
compiler. Isolated from the as-built engine (imports nothing from `rewriter.py`/`world_model.Graph`),
non-throwaway.

- **`harneskills/isa/attrgraph.py`** — the label-less attribute substrate. Opaque-identity nodes + a
  closed-key attribute bundle (`GRADED` degree∈[0,1] / `VALUED` open data), directed unlabeled edges. The
  label guard is structural: the sole index is `key→{nid}`, never by value — two nodes both `name="Paul"`
  stay distinct. Deterministic ids (no clock/RNG).
- **`harneskills/isa/machine.py`** — reference `Machine`. Matching core SEED/FOLLOW/TEST/JOIN (positive),
  FUZZY (graded SEED, α-cut + t-norm score), GRADE (graded α-cut or valued cmp), SET/DUP; effects MINT
  (Skolem/reify/chunk), EMIT (monotone graded raise / valued assert), DROP_CTRL (deletes an edge, REFUSES a
  fact edge). State = (regs, score); score composes by t-norm (min default, product selectable). Two-phase
  match-then-apply.
- **`docs/graph low level machine/isa-reference.md`** — the spec + the honest verdict.
- **`tests/test_isa_machine.py`** — 14 conformance programs.

VERDICT (what the experiment decided): the positive core + monotone/control effects + MINT enumerate
cleanly, and the vision.md §5 monotonicity invariant is now a PROPERTY OF THE OPCODE SET — no opcode
deletes a fact edge or lowers a degree, so illegal fact-deletion is unrepresentable (design payoff #1).
Existentials fold into MINT (no new primitive). Aggregation does NOT fit the per-state opcode shape (it
folds across the whole state stream) → keep it a `<call>` calculator, freeze the positive-core ISA.
Still design-hygiene, NOT the critical path (graded means-selection remains the immediate build). Memory
`finding-isa-reference-machine`.

**Then the lowering + differential test landed (304 tests).** `harneskills/isa/lowering.py` +
`tests/test_isa_lowering.py` (5 tests): a dumb `Rule`→ISA-program lowering, a name-`Graph`⇄`AttrGraph`
bridge (`to_attrgraph` — a former node NAME becomes the valued attribute `name="…"`, edges copied 1:1), and
a fixpoint driver (`run_to_fixpoint` — fired-suppression keyed by binding, the engine's own `fired` set, so
recursive/transitive rules terminate). `lower_rule` pivots each `Pat` on its rel node (SEED-by-name or FOLLOW
from a bound/literal anchor, then subject=predecessor / object=successor, binding fresh / `SAME`-checking
bound / `TEST`-ing literal; RHS→`MINT` reified relation), and raises `Unlowerable` on anything outside the
positive/monotone/non-graded fragment. Two machine ops added: `SAME` (register unification for already-bound
join endpoints) and `MINT.in_edges` (a reified relation needs an in-edge). RESULT: the machine reproduces
`rewriter.run` EXACTLY on a 2-clause conjunction, transitive CLOSURE (recursion), and a 4-clause join whose
last clause has both endpoints bound (`SAME`), plus the near-miss.

**Then graded α-cut lowering + the GOAL-DIRECTION shift (310 tests).** `lower_graded`: a non-inverted
`GradedCondition` lowers to one `GRADE(var, dim, threshold)` per dim — under the min t-norm exactly
`rewriter.graded_degree` (the bridge now carries embedding dims across as graded attributes). Differential-tested:
the machine's per-state score equals `graded_degree` on the passing bindings and the α-cut gates the same
derivations (`tests/test_isa_lowering.py`, +2). Then — steered by the user, *"switch from forward-rushing to
fixpoint to acting toward a goal"* (§6a "Everything is goal-directed") — `harneskills/isa/goal.py`
(`GoalSolver`/`solve_goal`, `tests/test_isa_goal.py`, +4): a demand-forward driver = rule-head index + sideways
information passing + tabling over the same positive core (no trail, no NAF). A `Goal` is a partial relation;
answering it materializes ONLY the demanded facts. MEASURED contrast: over two disjoint `isa` chains,
`run_to_fixpoint` derives the full closure of both, while `solve(isa, x, w)` materializes a strict subset and
never touches the irrelevant chain. `run_to_fixpoint` is now the differential-test harness and the contrast; the
DIRECTION is goal-directed.

**Then walkers — the long-range demand primitive (315 tests).** `harneskills/isa/walker.py`
(`Walker`/`walk_to_goal`, `tests/test_isa_walker.py`, +5): a fuel-bounded BFS demand token that carries a
reachability goal `rel(subj, obj)` hop-by-hop, spending one fuel unit per traversal — fuel is the content-blind
effort budget, so *"think harder" is literally more fuel*. It stays goal-directed (frontier confined to what the
source reaches), terminates through cycles (`visited`), and on arrival **materializes a shortcut** — the derived
transitive relation marked `shortcut: 1` (its provenance) — so a repeat query is O(1). Pinned: reaching `w` from
`x` needs 3 traversals, so fuel 2 fails and fuel 3 succeeds; a walk from the disjoint chain never touches `x`'s
facts; an unreachable target in a cycle terminates; a post-discovery small-fuel repeat succeeds on the direct
shortcut. This is the carrier a goal-directed driver spawns for an unbounded transitive subgoal instead of
enumerating it. The README was also reframed to the ratified principles (label-less attribute nodes +
goal-directed default as the headline, with a demarcated "What runs today" section separating the shipped
name-based engine from the built `isa/` reference slice).

**Then the walker was wired into `GoalSolver` (321 tests).** `tests/test_isa_goal_walker.py` (+6):
`GoalSolver(…, walk_fuel=N)` carries a **ground reachability goal on a transitive-closure relation** with a
fuel-bounded walker instead of tabling the whole chain — goal-direction with bounded long-range demand as one
driver. `_transitive_closure_rels` detects the exact shape `R(?a,?c) :- R(?a,?b), R(?b,?c)`; walking `R`'s base
edges *is* the transitive reachability, so the walker returns the same yes/no as tabling while materializing only
the one shortcut. Measured: `solve(isa, x, w)` under `walk_fuel` derives exactly `{x→w}` where pure tabling
derives `{x→z, x→w, y→w}` (a strict subset — bounded work); fuel bounds the reach (2 empty, 3 answers);
free-variable goals still fall to tabling; an unreachable ground goal returns empty with nothing materialized.

**Then the graded gate on the goal path (325 tests).** `tests/test_isa_goal_graded.py` (+4): a demanded goal
answered via a rule with a graded condition is **gated by the α-cut** — `GoalSolver._graded_degree` is
`rewriter.graded_degree` on the demand path (min over a condition's dims, α-cut at the threshold, min across
conditions). A failed cut suppresses the answer (an entity below threshold does not satisfy the goal); a surviving
answer records its degree in `solver.degree[(rel, s, o)]` (possibilistic — the most-confident derivation). Pinned:
a ground goal above the cut passes and records its degree; below the cut it is gated out with nothing
materialized; a free-variable goal returns only the entities that clear the cut; and the recorded degree equals
the engine's `graded_degree`. This is where goal-direction meets the graded layer. NEXT: NAC →
materialized-positive (the `decide` line) — the last reasoning piece for the defeasible contract scenario; then
deeper walker integration.

### clingo calculator — rule-driven aggregation (256 tests)
`asp.DISJUNCTION_RULES` + 2 tests — the clingo follow-up (a): RULES now build the disjunction call from
ordinary domain facts, so the calculator composes into pure reasoning with NO Python driver. A decision
is declared as facts (`?dec pred_of ?p`, `?dec domain_of ?type`), candidates are `?d is_a ?type`, and a
ruled-out member is `?d ruled_out ?p`; the rules materialize ONE `asp_solve` call and accrete every
candidate as `atom` / every ruled-out as `out`. MECHANISM: one materializer rule (bound only to the
decision → fires once) + plain-variable accretor rules that bind the existing call via its `decision`
link — because a fresh `<call>?` bound-literal token mints a NEW node per firing (verified: it does not
aggregate). End-to-end `run(g, DISJUNCTION_RULES, tools=TOOLS)` folds the winner back; ambiguous case
forces nothing (same soundness as the driver path). A fully NATURAL-language "exactly one of …" surface
stays gated on the two NL-front-end gaps (batch declaration-before-use; same-name merge).

### clingo scoped calculator — constructive disjunction / exactly-one (243 tests)
`harneskills/asp.py` + `tests/test_asp_calc.py` (4 tests) — the RECOMMENDED-NEXT arc step, the ONE
reasoning capability the stratified single-fixpoint engine cannot express (no head-disjunction, no
model enumeration), DELEGATED to clingo behind the §8 materialized-`<call>` boundary rather than
built into the monotone fact layer (`vision_agentic.md` §3). Driving case = the gap the riddles
pinned (`finding_riddles_probe`): "exactly one door hides the prize; not door1; not door2; therefore
door3" — a POSITIVE conclusion by exhaustion that closed-world `decide` cannot reach (it would wrongly
conclude `not door3`, since door3 is unproven). Reasoning by cases forces it; clingo's unique stable
model entails it.
- **Opaque discipline honored (vision §1/§8):** the calculator NEVER parses atom node names — it
  assigns each an anonymous index, hands clingo only `sel(0..k-1)`, and maps the solution back onto
  the real nodes. Program: `1 { sel(0);…;sel(k-1) } 1.` + `:- sel(J).` per ruled-out member.
- **Sound — never guesses:** the winner is emitted only under CAUTIOUS entailment (selected in EVERY
  stable model). All-but-one ruled out -> one model -> forced. Two live options -> two models ->
  nothing. Unsat -> nothing. Tests pin all three.
- **Composes in the engine loop:** `run(g, rules, tools=asp.TOOLS)` services the call at rule
  quiescence and the folded-back winner re-seeds ordinary reasoning (a consumer rule fires on it).
- **Opt-in dependency:** clingo is imported LAZILY (only when the calculator runs), declared as the
  `asp` extra in `pyproject.toml`; the core package imports and reasons without it. Test guards with
  `pytest.importorskip("clingo")`.
- **Follow-up (noted in `handoff_redesign.md`):** aggregating N atoms into ONE `<call>` from per-match
  rule firings (rules building the call, not just consuming its result) is the remaining integration
  step; the spike seeds the call via a driver helper, which the vision explicitly permits.

### Behavioral contract suite — the swap-safety net (239 tests)
`tests/test_contract.py` (4 tests) — representation-INDEPENDENT tests that pin what the system DOES,
not how it is built, so engine parts can be SWAPPED later against a fixed spec (HRG-backed matcher,
clingo-delegated negation, SLM front-end, Joern extractor — the `vision_agentic.md` seams). Asserts
ONLY through the public surface (CNL in via `load_corpus`/`Session.submit`; answers out via `ask`/
`.answer` — strings and booleans, never internals). Three scenarios span the substrate: graded +
defeasible routing, closed-world elimination (the thief riddle), and the compositional code hazard.
The internals-coupled regression tests (`test_new_core`, `test_code_frames`) stay as the CURRENT-
engine defense; this file is the swap net. An engine-adapter parametrization is deferred until a
second engine exists (YAGNI).
- **Two NL-front-end gaps surfaced while building it** (recorded in `handoff_redesign.md`): (1) the
  batch loaders (`load_corpus`/`load_facts`) do NOT sequence declaration-before-use, so a declared-
  relation FACT parses only on the sequential `Session.submit` path (the code-hazard scenario authors
  via `Session`); (2) an `is a X` RULE HEAD is silently dropped by `load_rules` (returns 0 rules, no
  error) — a "report, don't drop" smell; relational and bare-copula-marker heads work.

## 2026-07-02

### Indefinite existentials (∃) — question side (228 tests)
First reasoning-expressiveness gap (user-picked over disjunction/aggregation/negation). An
existential QUESTION `is anyone happy` / `is anything a dog` means ∃ — "does ANY witness satisfy
this" — so it now binds a VARIABLE over all nodes (`query.EXISTENTIAL_SUBJECTS` -> `Pat("?w", p, o)`)
instead of matching the literal word "someone" as a node name. Fixes the real bug: a NAMED individual
witnessed nothing (`bob is happy` but `is anyone happy` -> **no**; now **yes**). `everyone`/`everything`
are universal and deliberately excluded; `they`/`it` are anaphora. This is the query-side dual of a
labelled-null witness.
- **Existential FACTS already reason soundly in the Session** and are pinned by tests: `someone is
  happy` materializes a witness that forward-chains through rules (`is anyone calm` -> yes), and two
  existential facts stay DISTINCT (∃x.solid ∧ ∃y.liquid — no false contradiction, each separately
  witnessed) because the un-canonicalized Session keeps each mention a distinct node. The witness is a
  labelled null (a fresh anonymous *constant* — NOT a variable, which would be ∀), per the
  design discussion.
- **Deferred (next slice):** the sound-under-canonicalization representation — an explicit null tag +
  blank identity (RDF `_:bN`), so ∃-facts stay distinct on the batch/`canonicalize` path and unlock RDF
  blank nodes / OWL `someValuesFrom`; plus witness IDENTIFICATION (`someone stole it. the thief is bob`)
  via the existing `same_as`/merge machinery. `tests/test_existentials.py` (+8). Bench unchanged
  (488/509, 95.2%) — ∃ is isolated to `someone`/`anyone`-subject questions.

### Elliptical copula conjunction/negation — `is round and big`, `is young and not rough` (220 tests)
The biggest remaining unrecognized bucket (handoff "RECOMMENDED NEXT"). A SHARED-SUBJECT ellipsis:
`and <mod>` / `and not <mod>` after a copula clause `?cs is ?co` reuses the clause's SUBJECT and its
`is`, folding `?cs is <mod>` (rl_lhs) or a NAC on `?cs is <mod>` (rl_nac). The full-clause conjunct
(`... and they are calm`) already worked via the generic clause; this is the one-token modifier the
generic clause can't fold. In the SHARED body spine (`authoring.BODY_SPINE_FORMS`), so it works in
`if…then` universals, the prose `HEAD when BODY`, and the machine grammar alike. Raw-NL probe
(depth-1): sentences **461→488**/509, accuracy **90.1%→95.2%**, QDep-1 **79%→91%**.
- **Four forms** (`_ellipsis_cond`): positive/negated × modifier-at-end / modifier-before-boundary.
  Disambiguation is content-blind — an elliptical modifier CLOSES its clause (last token, or followed
  by a boundary kw `then`/`when`/`and`, now tagged `is_bnd`); a token followed by a non-boundary word
  is a full clause `S P O` and the generic path handles it. The reused copula is pinned to `is`
  (`?prev k_pred is?`), so an ellipsis only chains off a plain copula clause.
- **Chaining + mixed polarity** (`round and big and small`, `young and not rough and big`): each
  modifier reuses the ORIGINAL subject+copula and marks itself `body_end`, so the head grammar and a
  further `and` continue past it. The prior conjunct is found by its object (the `body_end` token,
  unique per position), role-blind, so an ellipsis chains off a positive OR a NAC prior conjunct.
- **Two spine guards** so the inert `_BODY_AND` domino (which still marks the modifier `body_subj`)
  can't mis-fold: the generic clause and the `not`-clause both NAC `?cp is_bnd` (a boundary kw is
  never a clause predicate — kills the spurious `big then they` / `big and small`).
- **Latent-bug fix** surfaced by the first `not`-led prose `body_subj`: `_dropped_conditions`
  compared `_obj(...)` (a node id) to `"yes"` — the `kw_not`/`kw_drop` exclusion never fired. Now
  compares the node NAME; also counts a folded `k_obj` as consumed (an elliptical modifier is a
  clause object, not subject). `tests/test_universals.py` (+5).

### Lexicon-as-data cleanup — declarable variables/auxiliaries; content-blind stratify (215 tests)
Hardening the "nothing hardcoded in Python" rule (user audit). Three moves:
- **The engine no longer knows `is`.** Object-aware stratification was special-casing `pat.p == "is"`
  (relation-routing in the engine, §1/§10). Generalized `_prod_key` to key EVERY predicate on
  `(pred, literal-obj)` with variable-object producers as wildcards — content-blind, only refines
  deps, planning unchanged.
- **Function-word lexicon is now DATA.** The new grammar words (`PERSON_VARS`/`THING_VARS` variable
  classes, `UNIV_NOUNS`, `VERB_NEG_AUX`) were hardcoded tuples with no KB override — unlike the
  precedent (`declared_pronouns` etc. = DEFAULT | declared). Added `declared_rule_variables`
  (`X is a variable` -> `?<word>`, doubles as a plural universal noun), `declared_auxiliaries`
  (`X is an auxiliary`), `declared_univ_nouns`; `rule_var_name` is graph-aware; the verb-negation and
  plural-universal forms are now graph-derived generators (`verb_neg_forms`/`plural_universal_forms`,
  like `degree_grammar_forms`) — static DEFAULT banks + a Session-added declared extension. So a
  domain can extend the grammar lexicon as data (`critters is a variable` -> `Cold critters are kind`).
- **`is an Y` form** added (vowel-initial categories: `doth is an auxiliary` now parses).
`tests/test_universals.py`. Probe unchanged (284/311, 89.9%).

### Verb negation + object-aware copula stratification (213 tests)
Two paired negation pieces. Probe (depth-1, 25 theories): sentences 278→**284**/311; degradation
warnings 8→**3**. Memory `decision_universals_to_laws`, `decision_depythonization`.
- **Verb negation.** `S does/do/did not V O` -> a NAC on the relation `S V O` (`authoring._verb_not_sugar`
  per `VERB_NEG_AUX`; the do-support auxiliary is is_kw-tagged so the generic clause defers, like
  `is not`). `the cat does not like the cow` -> NAC `cat like cow`; `they do not eat the cow` ->
  NAC `?x eat cow`. Works inside a conjunctive body + verb head (needs the verb declared, so heads
  don't mis-decompose). `tests/test_universals.py`.
- **Object-aware stratification (content-blind).** `stratify` keyed on predicate NAME, so all `is X`
  collided and an `is not` NAC false-cycled through the overloaded `is` (with `goal.satisfied` etc.)
  -> the rule was dropped by graceful degradation. FIX: stratification is now object-aware for EVERY
  predicate — keyed on `(pred, literal-obj)`, with a variable-object producer (`?x P ?y`) as a
  WILDCARD every `P`-NAC depends on (`authoring._prod_key`). NO relation name is special-cased (vision
  §1/§10 — no engine routing by relation); it only REFINES deps (never adds a cycle), so every bank
  is safe (a predicate that always uses one object, e.g. planning's `viable <yes>`, collapses to the
  old name-keying). Now `if someone is young and they are not rough then they are calm` + `bob is
  young` -> `is bob calm` = yes (was degraded to no). The documented cleaner cure for the `is`-overload
  cycle (was a `decide`/de-pyth follow-up), done without hardcoding the copula.

### Multi-word definite entities + stopword df-cap — probe unhangs (210 tests)
Probe-driven robustness fixes; the depth-1 25-theory probe now COMPLETES (was hanging) at **278/311
sentences (89%), 198 answered, 89.9% acc, QDep-1 80% (all 80 answered), QDep-0 97%**. Memory
`decision_verb_catalog`.
- **Multi-word definite entity merge.** `the bald eagle` decomposes to head `eagle` + attribute
  `bald`, but the first-token definiteness marking tagged `bald`, not the head — so `eagle` never
  merged → O(k²) coref HANG (theory 3). FIX: mark the WHOLE definite NP span `is_unique`
  (`forms._definite_forms`: seed `def_np` after a definite determiner, propagate across the span,
  mark each). Head merges → 1 node → fast + correct (theory 3: 128s → 0.34s at 8/8).
- **Stopword df-cap.** A mis-parsed query (multi-word subject with no `the` shoves the VERB into the
  object slot) then coref'd a relation predicate with many instances → hang. FIX: a content-blind df
  cap (`Session.COREF_DF_CAP=24`, vision §14) — a name borne by >cap nodes is a STOPWORD, skip coref
  (a count is structure, not meaning). Makes the resolver robust to any such mis-parse.
- **Bench.** Queries entities WITH `the` (`does the S V the O`) so a multi-word entity decomposes the
  same on both sides. Residual: a COPULA question with a multi-word subject + bare predicate (`is the
  bald eagle young`) still can't split (the pre-existing Tier-3 limit). `tests/test_verb_catalog.py`.

### Plural-noun universals — `Cold things are kind` (208 tests)
A second universal surface, the biggest remaining unrec bucket in the depth-1 probe (~18 sentences).
`<Adj> <plural-noun> are <Pred>` (`Cold things are kind`, `Cold people are green`) = "all things that
are Adj are Pred" -> `?x is Pred when ?x is Adj`. `authoring.PLURAL_UNIVERSAL_FORMS` (per noun in
`UNIV_NOUNS`={things,people}) reuses the if/then rule fragment + variable machinery unchanged: the
plural noun is the bound variable (`things`→`?y`, `people`→`?x`, added to `forms.PERSON/THING_VARS`),
the leading adjective the single body condition, the copula predicate the head. FIRST SLICE: single
adjective + single predicate (positive → clean runtime, no stratification risk); multi-adjective +
`All`/comma (`All young, cold people are green`) stays unrecognized (never mis-folded).
`tests/test_universals.py`.

### Verb catalog + definiteness-merge — relational NL, fast (206 tests)
The n-ary/relational NL axis (the ceiling after universals→laws). Memory `decision_verb_catalog`;
`tests/test_verb_catalog.py`. **User-driven design call:** an undeclared verb is indistinguishable
from a multi-word noun phrase, and the engine has no learning yet (vision §10 lists induction as
OPEN), so we do NOT infer a verb from position — that is a weak stand-in for the deferred learning,
and "this word is a verb" is a MEANING commitment that brushes the content-blind line (§14). Verbs
are a CATALOG, declared as DATA (`eat is a relation`) like the rest of the domain; inference is
demoted to at most a linter hint. The CNL stays "caveman" (one base verb form); English inflection
is corpus-adaptation, not grammar.
- **The catalog reuses everything — almost no new code.** A declared relation word joins the surface
  KEYWORD set, so (a) the NP decomposition STOPS at it (the same fix that enables recognition — the
  bug and the feature are one) and (b) the generic body clause folds it inside a universal rule. So
  relational facts (`the dog eat the squirrel` → `dog eat squirrel`), verb-clause rules (`if
  something eat the cat then it chase the dog` → `?y chase dog when ?y eat cat`), and multi-step
  reasoning ALL worked out of the box once a catalog was declared — verified before writing any code.
- **The only new engine piece is the question side.** `forms.relation_question_forms` generates a
  `does S V O` yes/no form per declared relation (mirrors `relation_forms`; reflects to the same
  `<query>` yesno `query.ask` already runs). Binary relations use the plain `s v o` shape (like
  declared `relation_forms`), NOT the event reification (that's for ditransitives). Wired into
  `Session.submit`'s question path + exported.
- **Definiteness → uniqueness → merge (the perf+correctness fix; user-driven).** Relational facts put
  entities in object position, so same-named mentions multiply and the lazy per-query coref goes
  O(k²) + `same_as` saturation — measured 5–16 s/query, the full probe HUNG. The user surfaced the
  root cause by asking "how do we KNOW entities are unique?": ProofWriter entities ARE unique, but the
  pure-§3 model reads bare repeats as distinct witnesses. FIX (opt-in per domain, not universal): read
  DEFINITENESS from the article. `the X` = one individual — the missing definite/indefinite axis
  (`memory/decision_quantification_coreference`). Opt in with `the is a definite`
  (`forms.declared_definites`); the determiner-strip form marks `the X` entities `is_unique`, and
  `Session._merge_unique` COLLAPSES a unique name's mentions to ONE node (SCOPED merge — entity names
  only, not the blunt global `canonicalize`). Correct AND O(mentions): ~1000x (0.02 s for 3 questions
  vs 141 s). MEASURED that `is_unique`+force-coref is WORSE (same O(k²) walk); merge must run BEFORE
  `_derive` (unify a name's split facts, then compose cross-name `same_as`). Default (no opt-in)
  keeps the distinct-witness model — existing `is one thing`/`same as` tests unaffected.
- **Question-form simplification (user challenge).** The generated per-relation `relation_question_forms`
  was over-built: a question is gated by its `does` marker, so a SINGLE generic static rule
  `does S P O -> <query> yesno` (in `query.QUESTION_FORMS`, like the generic copula `is S P O`) binds
  the predicate freely. DELETED `relation_question_forms`; only the declarative side stays per-relation.
- **Bench.** `bench/proofwriter_nl.py` DECLARES `the is a definite` + each theory's verb catalog (base
  forms from the representations), caveman-normalizes inflection (`_base`/`_caveman`), and asks
  relational `does X V Y` questions. MEASURED (depth-1, 15 theories): sentences recognized 98→**173**/198,
  answered 81→**114**, accuracy 75→**79%**, QDep-1 52→**65%**; and the probe now completes in seconds.
  LIMITS: verb negation (`does not eat`), multi-word entities in a relational clause (`the bald eagle`
  mis-decomposes — the next ceiling), ellipsis, and the `is not` copula-stratification degradation.

### Universals→laws (first slice) — NL `if BODY then HEAD` parses to a rule (198 tests)
The highest-leverage NL grammar gap from `finding_raw_nl_coverage`: a natural-language universal
`if someone is rough then they are young` now parses to the executable rule `?x is young when ?x is
rough`, end-to-end through `Session` (assert → reason → explain). Memory
`decision_quantification_coreference` / `finding_raw_nl_coverage`; `tests/test_universals.py`.
- **The bound variable's NL surface is a quantifier+anaphor pair.** `someone`…`they` and
  `something`…`it` each denote ONE bound variable, not entities: a universal binds all witnesses BY
  NAME (decision_quantification_coreference), so the two words UNIFY to a single rule variable with
  NO coreference. `forms.rule_var_name` maps the person class → `?x`, the thing class → `?y`.
- **Reuse, don't reinvent.** `authoring.IF_THEN_FORMS` (two forms) reuse the shared body spine
  (`BODY_SPINE_FORMS`) + the copula sugar and fold the trailing head triple into the same
  `rl_subj/rl_pred/rl_obj` the prose `when` grammar uses. `expand_rules` then applies `rule_var_name`
  when reflecting the fragment — the name-op lives on the calculator side of the quote/eval wall, so
  NO `?x` node is ever minted in the graph (the "gap" that supposedly blocked this did not).
  A literal-subject rule (`if the lion is angry then the lion is loud`) reflects as a GROUND
  conditional — exactly right for ProofWriter's `if the lion … then the lion …` rules.
- **Wiring.** `are`→`is` copula morphology is a lexical step (`forms.normalize_lexical`); the `then`
  of a rule is kept distinct from the `X then Y` sequencing form by an `if_ctx` NAC set in a surface-
  normalization stratum (no race). In `Session`, a rule line's pronouns are NOT resolved to the
  discourse subject (they are variables) — detected content-blind by the `if`/`then`/`when` keywords.
- **Scope = COPULA laws** (`is [not] O`), single or non-elliptical conjunctive body. `load_universal_rules`
  is the batch entry. KNOWN LIMITS (all pre-existing gaps, now surfaced): n-ary VERB clauses
  mis-decompose as multi-word NPs (undeclared-verb gap → dropped); `is not` parses to a NAC but its
  runtime is limited by the coarse copula stratification (all `is X` share pred `is` → false cycle
  with `goal.satisfied` → graceful degradation; fix = object-aware copula stratification); elliptical
  conjunction (`is round and big`) not folded. The remaining QDep≥1 NL ceiling is now the VERB axis.

### De-pythonization — provenance as substrate, retraction & decide as rules (178 tests)
A keystone arc (docs/depythonization_design.md, memory `decision_depythonization`), driven by the
user challenging two seams: "why do tools trigger decisions?" and "why is provenance inert to the
matcher?". Both were right. This **supersedes** the "engine-driven tools" entry below — the decide
tools it added are now deleted.
- **Provenance matchable, per rule** (§2). `_is_inert` no longer hides provenance from ALL rules;
  a rule that NAMES a provenance predicate (`proves`/`uses`/`unless`) is provenance-aware and the
  matcher lifts the inert-bind refusal only for it (`rewriter._pats_touch_prov` → `_try_bind`).
  Ordinary rules are byte-identical (seed-from-ground already kept them off provenance). The
  "third category" (meta/TMS rules) is a LINTER LABEL, not an engine type; motivation =
  fact-layer confluence; meta-rules fire with `provenance=False` (regress guard).
  `tests/test_provenance_matchable.py`.
- **`rewire` primitive + interposition** (§4). A general control-layer `cut`/`link` raw-edge op
  (`Rule.rewire`, `apply_rule`) — the identity/provenance-preserving structural edit `drop`+re-add
  can't do. Retraction hides a fact by splicing an (inert) `<retracted>` node into its 2-hop path;
  resurrect is the inverse. Matcher untouched. `tests/test_rewire.py`.
- **Cascade as meta-rules** (`retraction.RETRACT_RULES`). Seed `<retract> targets ?rel` → CASCADE
  propagates along `proves`/`uses` → INTERPOSE hides each. FINDING: the EXACT "all justifications
  defeated" cascade is non-stratifiable (§11 forbids); the AGGRESSIVE form (retract if SOME j uses
  a retracted fact, unless axiom) is stratified and correct for single-support (multi-support =
  aggressive + re-derive, deferred). `tests/test_retract_rules.py`.
- **The decide completion/defeat stack is now rules.** Completion = a generated rule
  (`decide.completion_rule` via `authoring._completion_rules`), consumed positively; defeat =
  `DEFEAT_SEED` (`?c is ?p and ?c is_not ?p` → retract the negative) onto `RETRACT_RULES`.
  `decide.solve` = derive+complete (provenance on) then, iff defeated, the retraction pass (off).
  Deleted the whole tool/`<decide>`/`complete`/`recheck` machinery. FINDING: a completion NAC on
  `?c is P` false-cycles through the overloaded copula `is` (consumer produces `is thief`), so
  completion is AGGRESSIVE + MONOTONE (no NAC) and DEFEAT repairs — the mirror of the aggressive
  cascade. `tests/test_decide.py` rewritten; riddles unchanged. Full de-pythonization AUDIT of
  `harneskills/*.py` in the design doc: engine clean, no BLOCKS; remaining seams are `query.ask`,
  `session._assert` (parked), `coref_on_demand`→walker, `rule_graph` property-laws (quote/eval gap).

### Coref as rules — `Rule.meta` + the check-before-commit cursor (187 tests, DONE)
De-pythonization follow-up COMPLETE: `coref.coref_on_demand`'s Python generate-and-test loop (the
audit's other real seam — a tool handler that inspected `<contradiction>` and DECIDED which links
to keep) is migrated to rules; the old module, `cascade_retract`, and the `<quarantine>` cluster
are DELETED. Design + findings in `docs/coref_as_rules_design.md`.
- **`Rule.meta` — per-rule provenance** (`production_rule.Rule`, `rewriter.Rewriter.run`). A
  `meta=True` rule fires provenance-silent even in a prov-on run (the regress guard, previously
  enforced by a separate `run(prov=False)`), so reasoning (prov on, for the support chain) and
  TMS/meta rules can share ONE run. `RETRACT_RULES` marked `meta`. `tests/test_meta_provenance.py`.
- **The `<coref>` cursor** (`coref_walk.py`) walks a name's mention pairs ONE at a time, driven by
  rule firing + the engine's fixpoint-then-service cycle (a trivial `settle` barrier `<call>`) —
  **no Python driver loop** (the user's constraint: iteration must be emergent, like the walker's
  BFS). A thin materializer lays the mentions as a linear `<coref-pair>` chain (demand scope, by
  name — rules can't gather by name); `advance` moves the cursor (positive on `pnext`, ends
  naturally). `tests/test_coref_walk.py`.
- **FINDING: retraction cannot share a run with propagation.** Wiring a serialize+retract reject
  blew up — cascade hides a `same_as` fact, `force_all` re-runs the monotone propagation, it
  re-derives, they fight (nodes 74→1830 in four steps). This is why `cascade_retract`/`decide.solve`
  isolate retraction. So the plan pivoted.
- **CHECK-BEFORE-COMMIT (the pivot, user-chosen).** Coref becomes purely ADDITIVE: detect the
  disqualifying clash from the two endpoints' sort closures BEFORE linking (`?a is_a ?s1, ?b is_a
  ?s2, ?s1 disjoint_from ?s2 ⇒ not_same_as`), and COMMIT `same_as` only if none. No hypothesize,
  no cascade, no retraction, no propagation-fight — and it kills `cascade_retract` by removing
  coref's NEED to retract (goal met by elimination). Transitive-aware (each commit's propagation
  extends the endpoints' sorts before the next pair's barrier). A one-step `checked` delay orders
  clash-before-commit (a barrier-gated NAC = stratified negation, which §11 permits — the earlier
  "no NAC" was too strong). Greedy/order-dependent = the original `coref_on_demand`'s semantics.
- **`force` / resolver / Session / deletions** all landed: `FORCE_COMMIT` (link every pair so a
  `X is one thing` mistake surfaces a real `<contradiction>` under detection); a `resolve` tool
  wrapping the oracle for consistent-but-ambiguous pairs; `resolve_coref`/`coref_request_handler`
  wired into `Session`; `coref.py` + `cascade_retract` + the `<quarantine>` mechanism DELETED
  (`retract`/`RETRACT_RULES` is now the sole TMS path). Instance-vs-name fix: `clash_rules` are
  generated per `disjoint_from` declaration with LITERAL cat names (a generic instance-bound rule
  missed across distinct same-name `teacher` nodes in `Session`).
- Deferred as SEPARATE arcs (not loose ends): the general propagate-then-retract path
  (generalization hook); retiring `canonicalize` from the batch load path (gated on universals→laws).

### Follow-up: `unless` OUT-LIST machinery deleted (178 tests)
De-pythonization follow-up (handoff step 1). The JTMS `unless` OUT-LIST edge is fully retired now
that defeat is coexistence-driven (`DEFEAT_SEED` matches a live positive next to a completed
negative — no bookkeeping edge to watch). Deleted `provenance.add_unless` / `unless_watch` /
`completion_js` and the `UNLESS` predicate constant, and dropped `"unless"` from
`provenance.PROVENANCE_PREDS` + `world_model._INERT_NAMES` (and the matching exports/comments). No
code wrote or read an `unless` edge anymore. (The CNL `applies unless X present` NAC keyword is
unrelated — it never mints an `unless` relation.) Byte-identical behaviour; pure dead-code removal.

### The decide loop is engine-driven — `complete`/`recheck` as tools + triggers (167 tests)
Handoff step 1 #2, DONE. The last hand-sequenced driver in the decide stack is gone: `decide.solve`
no longer loops `run_rules` + `complete` + `recheck` in Python. The two decisions are now
materialized `<call>`s (dispatch.py) the engine services at its rule-fixpoint — which is EXACTLY
the per-tuple producer-fixpoint completion needs, since `rewriter.run` services a `<call>` only
once the rules have quiesced (producers done → the completion is sound by construction).
- **Two tools** (`decide.complete_tool`/`recheck_tool`, `DECIDE_TOOLS`) wrap the unchanged
  primitives — so `test_decide.py` still drives `complete`/`recheck` step by step (the per-step
  contract is untouched); only the loop that invoked them moved into the engine.
- **Two content-blind triggers.** `COMPLETE_TRIGGER`: a standing `<decide>` demand → `<call>
  complete` (fires ONCE per demand — the rewriter's `fired` set dedups the binding, so no busy
  loop; emitted early, serviced late at quiescence). `RECHECK_TRIGGER`: the defeater made
  MATCHABLE — the completion's `unless` OUT-LIST is inert, but a live positive `?c is ?P`
  COEXISTING with a completed `?c is_not ?P` is precisely "a defeater now holds for a completed
  tuple", so `?c is ?P and ?c is_not ?P → <call> recheck`. This is the demand-scoped re-decision
  trigger the handoff flagged: it fires ONLY when a positive appears for an already-completed tuple
  (the watched extension changed), and after `recheck` retracts the negative the `is_not` edge is
  gone → it cannot re-fire. (The two clauses bind the SAME property node because a plain-literal
  concept resolves to the one shared node, `rewriter.apply_rule`.)
- **`solve` is now three lines** — register `DECIDE_TOOLS` alongside any caller tools, append the
  two triggers, one `run_rules`. Still a no-op beyond plain `run_rules` when nothing is decided (no
  `<decide>` → no complete trigger; no completed negative → no recheck trigger).
- Two new `test_decide.py` cases drive the whole loop through `solve` (completion with no manual
  sequencing; a later positive defeating a completion via the engine trigger). Riddles unchanged.
  See `memory/decision_forcing_a_decision`.

### The grammar authors a decide-consumer — closed-world `is not` onto `decide` (165 tests)
Handoff step 1, DONE (riddle-confirmed): a riddle now authors ENTIRELY in CNL — the two hand-built
consumer rules (`_THIEF`/`_CULPRIT`), the explicit `suspects` list, and the hand-sequenced
`complete`/`recheck` loop are all gone. This is design **C** (the substrate route, not a Python
post-transform on compiled rules): the reflection reads in-graph CWA data and the rule is BORN as a
decided negation.
- **CWA in CNL** — `cleared is closed world` is a fact form (`form.fact.closed_world`) that emits
  the marker `cleared closes <closed_world>` that `decide.is_closed_world` already reads. The
  two-word object `closed world` self-excludes the copula (same additive idiom as `X is one thing`),
  so it is purely additive + linter-clean; no new keyword machinery.
- **CWA-aware reflection** (`authoring.expand_rules`) — a rule's `is not P` clause whose `P` carries
  the closed-world marker is UPGRADED: the NAC becomes a positive `?x is_not P` condition, and a
  companion `<decide>` demand rule (`decide.demand_rule`) is emitted that seeds the decision from the
  consumer's POSITIVE RESIDUAL (`?x is a suspect`) — the magic-set/`demand.py` pattern, so the tuples
  to decide are DISCOVERED, not hand-listed. The demand binds the concept node via its own marker
  (CWA-gated) and self-dedups (one live demand per tuple, `stratify` discards the self-dep).
- **Backward-compatible by construction** — a factless rule graph (`load_rules`,
  `load_machine_rules`) carries no CWA marker, so `is not` stays a NAC and the ~pinned grammar tests
  are untouched. Only the one-substrate `load_corpus` path (facts + rules together) upgrades. Open-
  world negation (icecream's `is not urgent`) is unchanged: no marker, no upgrade.
- **The reasoning driver** — `decide.solve(graph, rules)` loops `run_rules` + `complete` + `recheck`
  to a combined fixpoint; a no-op beyond one `run_rules` pass when nothing is decided, so an ordinary
  bank behaves exactly as before. (Expressing this loop itself as tokens serviced in `run` — so a
  caller need not sequence it — is the remaining refinement; see handoff.)
- Riddle probe (`tests/test_riddles.py`, 6 tests) rewritten: one CNL corpus per riddle, solved by
  `decide.solve`, plus `test_riddles_author_entirely_in_cnl` asserting the consumer has no NAC, a
  positive `is_not` lhs, and a generated `decide.demand.*` rule. See
  `memory/decision_forcing_a_decision` and `memory/finding_riddles_probe`.

### Riddles — an integration probe over reasoning + Q&A + explanation (164 tests)
First riddles (`tests/test_riddles.py`), the workload that pulls the whole stack through one
problem and pressure-tests the fresh negation work. A riddle is authored as a domain and SOLVED
by elimination: the answer is the entity for which a closed-world property cannot be derived.
- **"the thief"** — suspects ada/bo/cy; `in library -> innocent -> cleared` (multi-step deduction)
  clears bo, an alibi clears ada, so `cy is_not cleared` is COMPLETED (`decide.complete`); the
  consumer `?x is_a suspect and ?x is_not cleared => ?x is thief` fires for cy. Answered by the
  real `ask` (`who is thief -> cy`) and explained by the real `explain` (the trace bottoms out at
  `cy is_not cleared <- complete` — the elimination step, rendered from in-graph provenance).
- **"the broken vase"** — a second, independent riddle (yes/no + why-not, different predicate),
  confirming the completion path is not a one-off.
- **First composition of** multi-step deduction → closed-world completion → wh/yes-no answer →
  why-trace, all through the real surface (only the two consumer rules are hand-built).
- **What they surfaced (the "what to build next" signal):** (1) the CNL grammar cannot yet author
  a decide-consumer — an authored `is not` still folds to a NAC + stratify, so the two consumer
  rules are hand-built; **wiring the grammar's closed-world `is not` onto `decide` is the clear
  #1 next item.** (2) No constructive disjunction / "exactly one" — a puzzle whose answer must be
  derived POSITIVELY by ruling out alternatives (not the "one we can't clear" framing) needs the
  deferred indefinite-existentials/uniqueness axis. Files: `tests/test_riddles.py` (new, 5 tests).

### Forcing a decision — negation decided-on-demand, per tuple (159 tests)
Built the engine direction from `memory/decision_forcing_a_decision` (spike-validated 2026-07-01):
a closed-world negative is no longer read as a NAC over the ABSENCE of a fact, but DECIDED per
demanded tuple and materialized as an explicit positive the consumer matches — **the NAC dissolves.**
- **The one new primitive: a JTMS OUT-LIST `unless` edge** (`provenance.add_unless` / `UNLESS`,
  inert in `world_model._is_inert` + `PROVENANCE_PREDS`). A completion holds by the ABSENCE of the
  positive, which a `uses`-only (in-list) provenance cannot express; `J --unless--> watched-subject`
  records the atom whose derivation defeats it. Inert, so it never surfaces as a domain fact nor
  collides with the relation instances named for the decided property (the spike's two bugs). The
  advance over the spike: the `unless` edges now live IN THE GRAPH, so re-decision reads completions
  off the graph — no Python registry stand-in.
- **`decide.py`** — generic calculator drivers gated by in-graph markers (same category as
  `retraction.cascade_retract` / `coref_on_demand`, no domain predicate hardcoded):
  `declare_closed_world` / `is_closed_world` (CWA is per-predicate DATA), `seed_decide` (a `<decide>`
  demand), `complete` (at a producer fixpoint, license `c is_not P` + the completion `<j:complete>`
  for a demanded, closed-world, unproven tuple), `recheck` (a defeater now holds → `cascade_retract`
  the negative, which withdraws everything it fed FOR FREE via the consumer firing's `uses` edge —
  the TMS half needed no new code, as the spike found).
- **Why completion, not just demand, is load-bearing:** forcing the positive is completeness (monotone,
  never wrong); forcing the negative is SOUNDNESS — so completion is licensed only for a closed-world
  predicate at a true per-tuple fixpoint. Open-world stays UNKNOWN (`test_open_world_..._never_completed`).
  Decided-negatives are defeasible CONTROL and ephemeral: resurrection is automatic (the standing
  `<decide>` demand lets `complete` re-materialize if the positive is later withdrawn).
- Scope: unary copula property `P(c) == c is P` (positive `is`, negative `is_not`) — the validated
  shape. Generalizing to arbitrary `R(c, o)` and expressing the drivers as rules/tokens (finding #4)
  are the noted next refinements. The static `stratify`/NAC path is UNCHANGED (this is an alternative,
  not yet a replacement). Files: `world_model.py`, `provenance.py`, `decide.py` (new), `__init__.py`,
  `tests/test_decide.py` (new, 8 tests).

### Tier 3 REDONE as forms — surface grammar is rules, not imperative Python (150 tests)
On review (user: "why Python instead of CNL rules?") the first-cut `chunk_phrases` tool was
retired: it baked grammar/recognition decisions into imperative Python — the seam the vision
rejects. Rebuilt as NORMALIZATION FORMS (`forms.surface_forms`, run in ordered strata by
`normalize_surface`). The one concession: these forms may `drop` surface `next`/`first` edges —
the token chain is ephemeral scaffolding (control), so rewriting it is control-deletes-control
(§5), not fact deletion.
- **Determiners** → a bridge form drops the determiner and re-links the chain (`the`/demonstratives
  anywhere; articles `a`/`an` only when LEADING). NAC `?x kw` keeps a determiner inside a fixed
  keyword phrase (`is the same as`).
- **Multi-word entities DECOMPOSE, not merge** (user's call, and it removes the one "irreducible"
  name-join tool): a modifier before the NP HEAD becomes a gradable ATTRIBUTE — `the bald eagle`
  → head `eagle` + `eagle is bald`; `the big bald eagle` → `eagle is big`, `eagle is bald`.
  Structure is exposed to reasoning, not hidden in an opaque string. Gated to genuine
  determiner/quantifier-introduced NPs via a `det_np` tag (seeded after a determiner/article/`every`,
  propagated across the content run), so controlled-CNL still rejects gibberish (`glorp the flarn
  wibbit`) and an undeclared verb (`alice sends parcel` stays for the n-ary form to reject, not
  turned into attributes). The head is the token before a keyword (`np_head_kw`) or the chain end
  (`np_head_end`); a copula guard stops the end-case splitting a bare predicate (`is alice happy`).
  Decomposition is normalization, so recognition is measured AFTER it (a bare NP/gibberish is not
  "recognized" on an attribute alone; a real clause must fire).
- **Pronouns** (`it`/`they`/…) resolve to the discourse subject (`Session._last_subject`, a §14
  content-blind recency policy) by `expand_pronouns_text` substitution before tokenizing — anaphora
  is name-level coreference (the pronoun IS that entity, ONE node — no same-as twin), the same
  name-op category as `canonicalize`, kept minimal and OUTSIDE the grammar rules.
Both assert and question paths run the same strata (`query` gained `strata=`). `stratify` insight
applies by hand here (tag → seed → strip → decompose), which motivated the negation-protocol
discussion → memory `decision_forcing_a_decision`. **Known limit (unchanged):** a yes/no STATE
question with a multi-word subject AND a bare predicate (`is the bald eagle happy`) can't split
them. **Deferred:** indefinite existentials (`someone`/`something`). Supersedes the first-cut
`chunk_phrases` (atomic-name) entries. Files: `forms.py`, `query.py`, `session.py`, `__init__.py`,
tests.

### Grammar unification — prose + machine rules share ONE condition grammar (138 tests)
Retired the prose↔machine condition-grammar seam. Both surfaces now fold their rule BODY
through one shared spine (`authoring.BODY_SPINE_FORMS`): a generic positive clause `S P O`
(any predicate, no fixed menu), a `not S P O` NAC, and an `and`-domino. They differ only in
the HEAD (prose = single triple with stable `rule.S.P.O` keys + frames; machine = multi-clause
+ `drop`). Prose copula sugar (`is a` / `is not` / `is <adverb>` / `not in`) sits on top and the
generic clause NACs `is_kw` to defer to it; the NAC is inert unless prose `is_kw` tags exist, so
planning/walker/procedure banks are unaffected. `_dropped_conditions` re-based on `body_subj`
(now reports only malformed clauses, never silently drops). Removed the now-redundant
`relation_cond_forms` / `load_rules(relations=)`. Supersedes the part-1 declared-relation work
below. **Residual seam:** full HEAD unification (multi-head/`drop` in prose) deferred — higher
churn (~4 pinned key tests). Files: `authoring.py`, `machine_rules.py`, `session.py`, `__init__.py`.

### 1a proper-fix part 1 — declared relations in prose rule bodies (138 tests, +2)
Prose rule grammar honours declared relations in bodies via `relation_cond_forms` (later
superseded by the shared spine above). `?x visits dog` folds once `visits is a relation` is
declared; undeclared still raises. (Superseded same day by grammar unification.)

### Remediation Tiers 1 + 2 — silent-failure kills (136 tests, +2)
- **1a immediate fix:** prose `load_rules` used to silently DROP un-menued body clauses (rule
  then fired unconditionally). Now DETECTS via `_dropped_conditions` and RAISES, naming the clause.
- **1b:** documented tokenizer case-folding at `forms.tokenize` (CNL is case-insensitive; code
  building nodes directly must lower-case). No code change.
- **2a:** `run_rules` now degrades to the monotone (no-NAC) subset on an un-stratifiable theory
  and warns which NAF rules it dropped (was: raise, whole theory unreasoned). `strict=True` restores
  the hard failure; `stratify` itself still raises.
- **2b:** documented the deliberately stratified-only negation boundary in `vision.md` §11.
Files: `authoring.py`, `forms.py`, `vision.md`, tests.

### Remediation plan drafted — from the scale-beyond-toy probes
Prioritized punch-list: Tier 1 silent failures (done above), Tier 2 reasoning fragment (done),
Tier 3 surface-NL grammar (multi-word entities, determiners, pronouns/coreference), Tier 4
dense/hub-relation walk performance (bidirectional or df-gated). Tier 3 is the substantive
remaining build; Tier 4a is the one hard research item.

## 2026-06-30

### Coverage probe: ProofWriter — multi-step reasoning is EXACT (134 tests, bench-only)
Held-out ProofWriter theories loaded into the substrate (facts + `load_machine_rules`, CWA):
99.2% over 11,304 questions; **monotone multi-step deduction = 100.000% exact**. Whole residual
is NAF conservatism (stratified negation refuses negation cycles by design). Surfaced 4 silent
grammar gaps (prose multi-cond drop, multi-word entities, `~` NAF polarity, machine-rule literal
lowercasing). `bench/proofwriter_coverage.py`. Canonical: memory `finding_coverage_proofwriter`.

### Scale probe: WordNet — on-demand is flat in KB size after a matcher fix (134 tests)
WordNet noun hypernymy (166k nodes) answered by the demand-spawned `is_a` walker. Found the
matcher was O(graph)/step on the `is_a` stopword (df≈84k); fixed with O(1) `Graph.name_count`,
seed-from-the-rarest-anchor, and retiring `scope` as a real set. Result: flat 5.7→10ms across an
8k→166k node sweep (~120×). Fuel re-represented as a single counter node + `dec` tool (was N unary
edges = quadratic). Added stop-on-arrival NAC → is_a work now ∝ answer depth. Messy-graph probe:
clutter isolation passes at 188k; dense/cyclic relations flood the hub (the Tier-4 open item).
`bench/wordnet_scaling.py`, `bench/wordnet_messy.py`. Canonical: memory `finding_matcher_is_matching_bound`.

### Procedures + a latent NAC-semantics engine bug fixed (131 tests)
Procedures (`to brew get_water then add_beans then heat`, `procedure.py`) desugar to planner
operators; the `to NAME` header is a CNL-emergent form, the body a `then`-chain. Building the
`waits_for` before-gate exposed that `rewriter.nac_blocks` treated ALL `not` clauses as ONE
conjunctive NAC (so `unmet` had been cosmetic since the planner was written). Fixed via
`_nac_groups`: independent negation groups by shared free var (`not A and not B` = ¬A ∧ ¬B).
Canonical: memory `decision_nac_grouping`.

### ADVERB_THRESHOLDS moved to the KB — degree scale is now data (126 tests)
Deleted the last hardcoded lexical config. The adverb→degree scale lives in the KB as CNL facts
(`very is 0.8`); `graded_rules` / `degree_grammar_forms` / α-cut all generate from `_degrees`
(defaults overlaid with KB declarations). A user can declare `extremely is 0.95` with no code change.

### Prepositions declarable + engine-stays-stupid audit (124 tests)
Removed the frozen `NARY_PREPOSITIONS` list — `P is a preposition` drives n-ary roles as data.
Audit confirmed the engine never categorizes: `match` compares names as opaque strings, α-cut is
read off the rule; the only name-based engine special-case is `_is_inert` (structural provenance).

### N-ary relations + questions — event reification (124 tests)
`alice gives book to bob` reifies to a fresh event node with positional (subj/obj) + prepositional
role edges; only a DECLARED verb (`gives is a verb`) parses. N-ary questions (`who gives book to
bob`, `alice gives what to bob`) query one event node. `forms.nary_forms` / `nary_question_forms`.
First-slice limits: surface verb must match the declaration, single-word entities, one preposition.

### act/observe folded onto `<call>` — uniform tool dispatch complete (119 tests)
The last bespoke per-cycle tool step in planning is gone: acting is now an engine-serviced
materialized `<call>` like price and rank, folded into the planning fixpoint. Every §8 boundary
(price/rank/act/coref) is now uniform token-gated dispatch. Canonical: memory
`decision_materialized_tool_calls`.

### Explicit cross-name coreference — `X is the same as Y` (119 tests)
Declares two different names denote one individual; desugars to single-identity + an asserted
cross-link, reusing the single-identity machinery. Composes facts across the class; catches
cross-name contradictions.

### Explicit single-identity grammar — `X is one thing` (116 tests)
Declares single identity, overriding the distinct-witness default so a genuine one-entity mistake
(`ice is a solid` + `ice is a liquid` over disjoint sorts) is caught. `coref_on_demand(force=True)`.

### Connection model / matcher performance — measure-first (88 tests, suite ~1.2s)
Profiling overturned the assumption that `run()` is firing-bound: it is **matching-bound**
(`_triples`/`Graph.out` dominate). Landed: fixed a latent `Graph.copy()` index bug; live neighbour
views (no per-call set copy); bound-NAC → existence check; **seed-from-ground** matching (seed each
pattern from its most-selective ground anchor via the lexical index). Chain n=40 10,730→359ms (~30×).
Honest findings: rule-level anchor-delta is ~inert atop the index; semi-naive helps only deep-closure;
per-line Session reasoning stays whole-graph (name-matching across disconnected mentions is non-local).
See `docs/walkers_and_locality.md`.

### `within`/`radius` retired as the matching scope
Profiling showed hop-radius is mismatched to a name-keyed substrate (a single-pattern law finds a
disconnected mention through the index, not by hops) and a too-small radius silently truncated valid
long joins. Matching is now **unbounded and correct**; seed-from-ground keeps it cheap. `radius`
survives only as a vestigial ignored parameter. Canonical: memory `decision_locality_rete`.

### Walkers + locality — the connection model (114 tests)
Seed-from-ground matching; a demand-spawned **walker** gadget (origin + reached + target + fuel,
provenance-bearing shortcuts) in `walker.py`; token-typed walkers give fully concurrent traversal
on different relations with zero cross-wire. Walker rules and the entire planner now live in CNL
(`corpus/walker.cnl`, `planning*.cnl`); `planning.py`/`walker.py` have zero `Rule(` literals.
Canonical: memory `decision_walkers_locality`, `decision_machine_rule_cnl`.

### Materialized tool calls — `dispatch.py` (114 tests)
Tool calls are `<call>` nodes a rule emits; the engine services them at each rule-fixpoint via a
`tools=` registry passed to `run`/`run_rules`, folds output back in. Generalizes `external.py`'s
old request/dispatcher board (migrated). Machine rule CNL (`machine_rules.py`, `corpus/*.cnl`) lets
control/machinery rules be authored in CNL. Planning's `service_calls` folded onto `run(tools=)` —
the last holdout, ordered by DATA (`cost_settled` gate) not a hand-written cycle.

### Demand-driven selective coreference wired into Session + ask-user tool (83 tests)
The KB is now LAZY: asserting runs reasoning only; a question seeds a `<demand>` → rule →
`<coref-request>` → dispatcher → `coref_on_demand`. Coreference = pure §3 disambiguation: a
same-name clash means distinct entities, so bare repeats are distinct witnesses (three Session
detection tests flipped to assert consistency). `interaction.py` adds the user as an external
source (§8) — only consistent-but-ambiguous links are referred to an `Oracle`. Canonical: memory
`decision_quantification_coreference`.

## 2026-06-29

### Selective coreference first slice — on-demand + reversible TMS (77 tests)
New modules `provenance.py` / `retraction.py` / `demand.py` / `coref.py`. In-graph justifications
(`<j:KEY> --proves/uses-->`; `explain` traverses them, no journal); reversible quarantine + cascade
retraction; on-demand transitivity; coreference-by-reasoning (two distinct Pauls stay separate
because merging breaks consistency). Design: `docs/coreference_design.md`.

### Planning loop — goal → plan → act → replan, all as rules (41→59 tests)
`planning.py`: phases A (relevance) → B (connection) → C (ranked commitment) → D (acting) →
E (divergence→replan), entirely as rules, no planner. Ranked multi-option commitment by fact-layer
`cost` (`rank_by_cost` → `cheaper_than` → `dominated`/`best`/`choose`). External on-demand cost
lookup (`external.py`: request → dispatcher → tool → result; freshness via §5 supersedes, no
deletion). Real §8 act tools (observed effect may ≠ declared → real divergence). Design:
`docs/planning_design.md`. Guardrail: commitment may be control, but the criterion must be
fact-layer (graded cost).

### CNL-authored domains, Q&A, one-graph corpus loading (68→71 tests)
`authoring.py`: a whole domain (facts + rules + lexicon + loose form) authored in CNL; the
embedding-write is a rule effect (`rule.propagate`). `query.py`: ask the KB in CNL, get CNL
answers (recognition emergent, execution a §8 tool). `load_corpus`: a mixed corpus recognized
in ONE graph with no Python classifier; b2 fact-space pollution resolved with no engine scope
(bound-literal rule fragments + context-as-a-node bound by rules). Defeasible context tier (a):
a monotone defeasible default (explicit placement defeats the general rule via NAC, no retraction).
Session + REPL (`session.py`, `repl.py`). Housekeeping: ~74 old-paradigm files deleted; tests run
plainly (`pytest tests/ -q`).

## 2026-06-28

### Rebuild started — the one-substrate core
The old paradigm (typed predicates, smart planner, PCFG/EM, mappers/dispatcher/grounder, CNL Forms
compiler) was deleted; a clean core was built on `docs/vision.md`. Rules-as-graph-nodes (Prong B/b1):
`rule_graph.py` stores a rule as a literal-subgraph fragment; `write_rule`/`rules_in_graph` round-trip.
Relation-property meta-feature (`is_a is transitive` → a rule-node, two-phase). b2 meta-circular
execution parked. Canonical: memory `decision_one_substrate_vision`.
