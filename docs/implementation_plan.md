# Implementation Plan — Universal Graph Machine (ACTIVE / remaining work)

> **Status: THE ACTIVE PLAN (2026-07-12, post done-split).** This is the UGM-only continuation of
> the original `harneskills` plan. Completed phases + landed milestones + settled rationale trails
> moved to `implementation_plan_done.md` (2026-07-12). This file is ONLY the remaining work.
> The harness (planning rule banks, SLM, session, TUI) has its own plan in `harneskills`.
>
> Module paths after split: `ugm.xxx` (was `harneskills.isa.xxx`); `ugm.cnl.xxx` (was
> `harneskills.xxx` for CNL-level modules). Tests: `ugm/tests/`. Source: `ugm/ugm/`.
>
> Read first: `reference.md` → `vision.md` → `logic_fragment.md` → `processing_modes.md`
> → `graph low level machine/isa-reference.md` → `architecture.md`. Log landed work in `CHANGELOG.md`.
>
> Standing rules: no commits by the assistant; domain logic ONLY in banks; strategies are
> DECLARED data, never engine sniffing; correctness before raw performance.
>
> **RATIFIED 2026-07-10 (user): EQUIVALENCE WITH THE PREVIOUS (rewriter / name-based) GENERATION IS NOT
> A CORRECTNESS TARGET.** The old generation was never used. The goal is a **WORKING, self-consistent
> firmware system**, judged on producing sensible answers on the benches, NOT on reproducing the old
> exhaustive engine's outputs. Impossible-blocker chance < 5%. Real long-pole for a *usable* system =
> **performance (Phase 7)**, not correctness.

## Current state

**Suite: 258 passed, 0 failed** (`python -m pytest -q`, ~54s post perf-lever-(a)). Production runtime is
100% the ISA engine, and so is every test — no second engine anywhere in the repo. `ask_goal` is
demand-driven; `rewriter.py`/`goal.py`/`walker.py`/`decide.py`/`solve.py` are all deleted.

Phases 0–2, 3.1-step1, 3.3, 4, 5, 6.0/6.1, firmware v3 (demand-driven negation), stance-as-data, and
perf lever (a) are **DONE** — see `implementation_plan_done.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. **Do NOT re-do them;
do NOT resurrect `decide.solve`, `solve.py`, or the demand/coref/walk/asp leftovers.**

## Residuals carried out of done sections (don't lose these)

These were TODOs embedded in now-done phases; they live in the open work below:
- **`same_as propagates through X` CNL surface** (from Phase 3.1-step1) — needs coref rules reified;
  `coref_prop` is forward-compatible. Lands with Phase 3 rules-as-data. Also the mechanism half of the
  Phase 5.4 residual below.
- **APPLY-body graded α-cut + inverted ('not at all') cut** (from Phase 5.2 companion) — the CHAIN half
  is DONE (firmware v3 `chain._graded_ok`); the APPLY-body match-time cut remains. ⚠Opus.
- **`session.py:CONTENT_PREDS` + Python-generated coref rules** (from Phase 5.4 residual) — harness-side;
  resolves once coref rules reify (bank-authored `same_as propagates through X`).
- RETIRED / not carried: Phase 5.1's "aggressive `is_not` completion" (replaced by demand-driven NAF);
  Phase 2.2's "Phase-6 reader flip" (landed in Phase 6.0).

## Phase 8 — CLIENT: unified CNL intake + focus + streaming (ACTIVE — the current build)

> **This is now the primary track (2026-07-12, ratified with the user).** The first UGM *client* is an
> **agent loop with a TUI**, driven by CNL (the NL→CNL SLM is external; the system boundary is CNL). The
> load-bearing goal is **seamlessness** — a CNL utterance's own structure drives the loop with NO
> intent-recognition dispatcher. Full spec: **`docs/cnl_intake_design.md`**. This reroutes the plan onto
> the client build; the old NEXT STEP items become secondary/parallel tracks below. **Phase 3.2 (runtime
> rule edits) is ABSORBED here** (§8.6). The perf priority shifts from Phase 7a (total-KB size, wrong
> axis for this client) to **session accretion** (`docs/critique.md` §4.1a), answered by seed-from-focus.

**INTAKE-SPINE DISCIPLINE (anti-hardcoding — any session on Phase 8 MUST obey; reviewers reject diffs that
break one).** The spine is where the seamlessness claim is easiest to betray with a Python shortcut. Full
list: `docs/cnl_intake_design.md` §D. In brief: (1) route by which FORMS fired, never by sniffing the
utterance string; (2) focus moves (`focus on`/`forget that`/`back to`) are CNL forms, not `if "forget" in
text`; (3) pronoun ranking is DECLARED defeasible-priority data (content-blind defaults, domain-overridable),
not engine-baked; (4) rejection/"nearest forms" computed from recognition structure, not a hardcoded table;
(5) `<focus>`/`<query>`/`<goal>` are control tokens via the `<…>`→control chokepoint; (6) no predicate/
English-word STRINGS as control signals in intake code (vocab from `ugm/vocabulary.py`, domain preds from
the KB); (7) metareasoning owns only effort/margins, not answers. Litmus: grep intake code for a domain or
function word used as a control signal — if one is load-bearing, it belongs in a bank, not the engine.

Build slices, in dependency order (each with tests; the probe first to validate the premise):

- **8.0 — accretion + suspend/resume PROBE (first, diagnostic). PARTLY DONE 2026-07-12.**
  `bench/session_accretion.py` written. KEY FINDING (changed the picture): the near-term blocker is NOT
  accretion but PER-UTTERANCE NAF cost — a *bound* query on a bank with one `not …` rule was super-linear
  in the bank's entity count (`is s0 thief` over 6 suspects = 13.8s). Root cause: the NAC existence check
  `apply._find_fact_relnode` did a whole-predicate scan (lever-(a) never applied there). **FIXED** →
  endpoint-driven, 40× (m=6 13.8s→0.34s), suite 258 green + 54s→35s (CHANGELOG 2026-07-12). RESIDUAL
  super-linearity (m=12=5.5s) = levers (b) agenda re-servicing + (c) coref `same_as` fan-out; the profile
  is now flat. Seed-from-focus (8.3) bounds the coref fan-out by scoping — so the residual is addressed by
  the spine build, not a separate perf push. STILL TODO in 8.0: re-run the probe AFTER 8.3 to confirm
  focus-scoping isolates+flattens accretion, and that suspend/resume on `chain_sip` preserves the frontier.
- **8.1 — unified intake entry + routing. FIRST INCREMENT DONE 2026-07-12.** `ugm/intake.py`
  `ingest(kb, rules, utterance) -> Outcome`: routes fact / rule / question / unrecognized by which FORMS
  fire (not a string sniff), reusing `recognize`/`ask_goal`/`load_rules`/`load_facts`/`expand_rules`.
  Rule route appends + re-lints so a mid-session rule reasons immediately (Phase 8.6 seed). Gibberish/empty
  → the habitability rejection outcome (§4a). `tests/test_isa_intake.py` (6 tests, 264 suite green).
  STAGING: the caller-side fork is closed at the ENTRY; the QUESTION *parse* still runs off-graph
  (`recognize` throwaway) — collapsing it into a live control-flagged `<query>` node is 8.2. GOAL/command
  route + focus control-CNL are 8.3. Design §1, §D discipline obeyed (content-blind, no string sniff).
- **8.2 — `<query>`/`<goal>` as live control nodes. FOLDED INTO 8.3** (2026-07-12): a standalone 8.2 has
  no clean form — recognizing a question over the live graph via `run_bank` isn't scoped (it tags fact
  tokens' `is_kw`), and the live `<query>`'s only consumer (retention/GC) IS focus. So the transplant
  (recognize in a scratch scope → mint a control-flagged `<query>`/`<goal>` in the live KB) lands in 8.3,
  where focus-GC gives it a real lifecycle. Groundwork done: `tokenize(..., control=True)` (Phase 8.2).
- **8.3 — `<focus>` stack + centers + `<query>`/`<goal>` landing + seed-from-focus.** Pointer-at-center
  (extent DERIVED, not scope-as-subgraph); seed scope = top frame's centers; implicit widen-only + explicit
  `focus on`/`forget that`/`back to` (reuse SUPPOSE scope ops); `<query>`/`<goal>` land as control nodes
  retained/GC'd by focus reachability. Design §2, §3.
  - **8.3a DONE 2026-07-12** — `ugm/focus.py`: `<focus>` stack (top = frame nothing is stacked below-of),
    `push`/`widen`/`drop`/`reenter`/`top_centers`; implicit widen-only on assert (content-blind
    `utterance_subjects`); explicit `FOCUS_FORMS` (`focus on`/`forget that`/`back to`) recognized as forms,
    wired into `ingest` (route "focus"); drop/reenter are control-layer ops (§5-safe). Answer-neutral.
    `tests/test_isa_focus.py` (9), 273 suite green.
  - **8.3a remainder DONE 2026-07-12** — QUESTIONS widen focus too (`_question_entities`: bound subject/
    object, skipping who/someone unknowns); spent token-chain scaffolding GC'd per utterance
    (`focus.gc_utterance_scaffolding` — surgical to the utterance's own `<sentence>` chain, answer-neutral:
    facts live on entity nodes, grammar tokens swept). `tests/test_isa_focus.py` now 13, 276 suite green.
    DEFERRED to 8.5 (streaming): a PERSISTENT `<query>`/`<goal>` control node (needs the streaming consumer
    + focus-reachability GC of it, vs today's per-utterance chain sweep).
  - **8.3b DONE 2026-07-12** — seed-from-focus as BOUNDED ATTENTION, EXPOSED + caller-selected (user
    directive: "code using the system decides which mode"). `focus_scope: frozenset[str] | None` threaded
    through `chain_sip`/`_solve_demand_rule`/`_nac_blocks`/`_facts_matching` (the reader filters: a fact is
    visible iff an endpoint is in scope) + `check` + `ask_goal`; `ingest(attention="global"|"focus")` maps
    "focus" → the top frame's centers (widen-before-answer so a bound question's subject is in scope).
    Default None/"global" = whole-graph, behaviour-identical (278 suite green). Focus holds INDIVIDUALS not
    types (`_question_entities` excludes the copula object — a shared type would be a stopword-anchor).
    PROBE (`focus_probe`, bound `is s<k>_0 thief` as independent cases accrete): global 0.5s→5.5s→31s→112s
    (super-linear cliff); focus 23→29→65→83ms (FLAT); ratio 23×→1361× and climbing. Bounded attention makes
    per-utterance cost track the focus, not the session — the accretion fix, validated. `tests/test_isa_focus.py`
    (16). SEMANTIC: off-focus facts leave attention (agent-not-theorem-prover); that is the point.
- **8.4 — anaphora as reasoning.** Design §4.
  - **8.4a DONE 2026-07-12** — BARE PRONOUNS resolve against the focus SALIENT CENTER. `focus.salient_center`
    = highest recency-stamped center of the top frame (recency is an explicit `recency` attr — `relations_from`
    is NOT insertion-ordered; `_add_center` bumps on re-mention). `ingest` expands pronouns
    (`declared_pronouns` — data, domain-extensible) with that antecedent BEFORE routing (after the focus-op
    check so `forget that` is safe). Topic switch changes the antecedent (the stack governs it). ASK-VS-GUESS
    margin's degenerate case: a pronoun with NO antecedent → `Outcome("clarify")`, not a silent guess about a
    literal `she`. `tests/test_isa_focus.py` (24), 283 suite green.
  - **8.4b REMAINING** — DESCRIPTIVE anaphora ("the alibied one") → CHOOSE over centers by the description
    (folds into reasoning); graded recency/role ranking + type/number agreement; the full ask-vs-guess MARGIN
    on a near-tie (not just the empty case) → escalate via `ask_user`, the same channel as OWA gathering.
- **8.5 — event-emitting + resumable driver; suspend/resume `ask_user`.** Design §5.
  - **8.5a DONE 2026-07-12** — LIVE EVENT STREAM: `ingest(on_event=…)` emits `Event(kind, data)` at the
    route boundaries (focus / clarify / question / **ask** / answer / fact / rule / unrecognized), so a TUI
    renders a turn as it happens. The `"ask"` event brackets the human-in-the-loop `ask_user` gather (the
    §4 ask-vs-guess escalation). Additive: `on_event=None` (default) = no-op, behaviour-identical (287
    suite green). `tests/test_isa_stream.py` (4): `question→answer`, `question→ask→answer` (the gather),
    fact/focus/clarify. Works for a BLOCKING TUI (`ask_user` is a top-level suspension point already).
  - **8.5b REMAINING** — generator-based `converse` (yield events, `.send()` the ask answer) for a
    NON-BLOCKING UI: the "graph is the continuation" so suspend/resume needs no threads; PER-EMIT reasoning
    trace streaming reusing the RECORD/`<j:>` substrate (show each derivation as it fires); mid-CHAIN ask
    (currently `ask_user` is consulted only for the TOP goal, not a sub-goal the reasoning needs).
- **8.6 — runtime rule authoring (Phase 3.2, global KB concern).** `HEAD when …` lands via the same
  intake, reifies, reasons immediately; incremental head-index extend; RE-LINT stratification per add
  (`on_cycle` stance); conflict-lint AS CONVERSATION (a contradictory rule is rejected by ASKING, via the
  8.5 channel); disable = `<disabled>` marker (no deletion §5). Design §6.

**Model routing for Phase 8:** ⚠Opus for 8.1/8.2/8.3/8.5 (control/fact segregation, discourse model,
driver resumability — vision judgment); ✓S for 8.0 (probe/benchmark) and mechanical parts of 8.4/8.6
under the design spec.

## Secondary / parallel tracks (was NEXT STEP; run alongside or after Phase 8)

1. **Phase 5 exit gate — bench-sensibility half (harness-side).** Run card-trader + coref + full
   ProofWriter-coverage in `harneskills`. The engine half is MET in-repo (audited 2026-07-11); this half
   is not verifiable from this repo. NOTE: Phase 2.5 de-hardcoded the domain coref predicate list — coref
   now composes over `relation_predicates(graph)` + declared relations/prepositions, NOT a fixed engine
   list. A bench relying on a domain predicate composing across coref should Just Work if the predicate is
   present as a relation (default-grammar `in`/`has`/`before` included); if one regresses, DECLARE the
   relation in the harness KB — do NOT re-add an engine string.

2. **Phase 6.2 remaining (docs converge).** Two items left after the architecture-half landed:
   (a) refresh `reference.md`'s doc-map — it still lists `architecture.md` as pre-rehost / "must be
   rewritten at Phase 6.2", which is now stale (the rewrite landed 2026-07-12); also add the three engine
   docs (`architecture.md`, `engine_developer_guide.md`, `engine_user_guide.md`) to the LIVE map;
   (b) confirm finished phases are summarized in `CHANGELOG.md` (it is well-maintained; this is a
   verification pass, not new writing). ✓S.

3. **Phase 7(a) — the stated long-pole.** Now that 2.3 settled the name/key/value model, intern keys/
   values to ints + CSR adjacency + bitsets on a CLEAN representation (no bridge). ✓S for mechanical rungs
   with benchmarks; ⚠Opus for design.

4. **Demand-driven-negation PERF follow-on levers (b)(c)** (Phase 7-adjacent — the query is already
   sub-second at session scale, so this is optimization not correctness):
   - (b) semi-naive worklist so a demand re-services only when a relevant fact appeared (the round loop
     still re-services the whole local agenda each round; the profile's top is now `relations_from`/
     `_read_atoms` re-reading static reified-rule structure per service).
   - (c) the domain coref `same_as.*.is` demand fan-out.
   ALSO: `why` provenance is order-sensitive (a fact pre-derived without provenance renders `(given)`) —
   design AS-BUILT §5.

5. **Phase 3 remaining (rules-as-data / homoiconicity — off the critical path).**
   - **3.1 step 2:** demonstrate/prove pattern nodes stay fact-INVISIBLE when a rule fragment is folded
     into a live fact graph (control flag = segregation) — the one-graph fold. ⚠Opus (control/fact
     segregation). HAZARD: ephemeral APPLY frames add incoming edges to fact nodes; previewed and
     controlled by GC-after-pass, but the full fold needs care.
   - **3.2:** runtime rule edits by user CNL — **ABSORBED into Phase 8.6** (the client needs it as a live
     capability: add = same path as facts; disable = additive `<disabled>` marker; no deletion §5).
   - **3.4:** collections as first-class KB structure: member `next`-chains + list-authoring CNL forms
     (the ITERATE substrate — `processing_modes.md` §1). ⚠Opus.
   - Exit gate: every bank rule round-trips CNL → rule subgraph → rendered CNL.
   - NOTE: the meta-circular FORM-rule authoring (the quote/eval wall) is DEFERRED as a homoiconicity-
     purity milestone off the critical path (scoping decision 2026-07-09).

## Placeholders / optional follow-ons (not concrete tasks)

- **Broader FirmwarePolicy stance surface.** The stance-as-data work landed the two knobs the audit named
  (`negation_default`, `on_cycle`). A broader surface is a PLACEHOLDER — no third opinion is pending.
  Candidates ONLY if a workload needs one: CHOOSE tie-break / always-provenance `why` / default α-cut.
- **Prose `suppose … predict …` sugar** folding to slice 3c's reified encoding (new surface → SLM debt;
  deferred like `to NAME`, pick up if the SLM ledger is being retrained).
- **`tests/test_joern_corpus.py`** — legitimately slow, live-Joern; candidate for a `slow` marker.

## Phase 7 — PERFORMANCE track (after correctness — user standing rule)

In leverage order:
- **(a)** Intern keys/values to ints, CSR adjacency, bitset candidate sets — see NEXT STEP item 3.
- **(b)** Rust (PyO3) inner loop for Machine + store; Python stays the shell.
- **(c)** Per-rule AOT codegen = partial evaluation of APPLY (Soufflé-style), differentially gated.
- **(d)** Two-tier execution for runtime-edited rules — fresh rules interpret, stable-hot rules compile in
  background, version-stamp invalidation on edit. JIT (Cranelift/copy-and-patch before LLVM) only if
  profiling demands it.

## Model routing

⚠Opus = needs vision-judgment; ✓S = Sonnet-safe where a gate/spec catches deviation.
- Phase 5 exit gate (classify divergences / bench sensibility): **⚠Opus**
- Phase 6.2 remaining (doc-map refresh + CHANGELOG verification): **✓S**
- Phase 7(a) (intern/CSR/bitset): **✓S** with benchmarks for mechanical rungs; **⚠Opus** for design + AOT
  codegen
- Perf levers (b)(c) + `why` provenance ordering: **✓S** with benchmarks / differential gate
- APPLY-body α-cut + inverted ('not at all') cut: **⚠Opus**
- Phase 3.1 step 2 (one-graph fold): **⚠Opus** (control/fact segregation). 3.2/3.4: **⚠Opus**

## Risks

- **Session accretion is the client's real perf risk** (`docs/critique.md` §4.1a), NOT total-KB size —
  the monotone graph grows with the transcript. Answered by seed-from-focus (Phase 8.3) and validated by
  the 8.0 probe. Phase 7a interning is the WRONG axis for the agent-loop client; deprioritized.
- **Habitability at the CNL boundary** (`docs/critique.md` §4.4) — an unrecognized utterance must be an
  actionable rejection ("didn't understand X; nearest forms"), not a dead end. Falls out of the unified
  intake (Phase 8.1/§4a) as the empty-recognition case.
- **Performance (Phase 7) is the long-pole for the GENERAL engine** post the no-equivalence ratification;
  for the client it is reframed as session accretion above. Correctness risk is < 5% impossible-blocker.
- **SLM surface debt** accumulates from CNL form changes — batch retrains via the ledger in `harneskills`
  (`handoff_slm_surface_track.md`).
- **One-graph fold hazard (Phase 3.1 step 2)** — ephemeral APPLY frames add incoming edges to fact nodes;
  previewed and controlled by GC-after-pass, but the full fold needs care.
- **Meta-debugging** — the Phase 4 trace renderer is the mitigation; it is complete.
